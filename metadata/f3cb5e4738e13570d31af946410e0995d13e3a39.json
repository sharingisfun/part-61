Brian Babin (R-TX)\r\n\r\nHow the Senate Is Supposed to Work\r\nMitch McConnell - The Wall Street Journal\r\nPeople often ask me what President Obama is like. I always tell them the same thing. He's pleasant enough, but he's also like the kid in class who exerts a lot of energy trying to make sure everybody thinks he's the smartest guy in the room. He is also a very liberal guy who is determined to force our country into the kind of progressive model that Western European societies embraced years ago, whether the rest of us like it or not.\r\n\r\nBABIN: Criminal Aliens Granted a 'Revolving Back Door' onto our Streets\r\nOn today's program, Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX) discussed his new bill, the Criminal Alien Deportation Act. This legislation is designed to &quot;start twisting the arms&quot; of foreign nations that refuse to accept criminal aliens back into their countries. Babin's bill proposes cutting off foreign aid to nations that refuse to cooperate, and immediately cutting off their visa program until they comply.\r\n\r\nShirley Husar - Columnist writer for the Washington Times; CA Delegate\r\n\r\nHow Clinton can own her email scandal\r\nCharles D. Elliso - The Hill\r\nSomehow, somewhere along the campaigning way, badly placed emails became a political &quot;thing.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nClinton Might Not Be the Nominee\r\nDouglas E. Schoen - The Wall Street Journal\r\nThere is now more than a theoretical chance that Hillary Clinton may not be the Democratic nominee for president.\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.lauraingraham.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3cb5e4738e13570d31af946410e0995d13e3a39","amp;dn":"The-Laura-Ingraham-Show-Podcast+JUNE+1+%2C+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3cb5e4738e13570d31af946410e0995d13e3a39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,203,94,71,56,225,53,112,211,26,249,70,65,14,9,149,209,62,58,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
