These tasks have come about because it appears possible to reach a new level of mathematical modelling and numerical solution that will lead to a much deeper understanding of nature and to great improvements in engineering design","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8d3d4c183d432068092b3f82d2aa83f37ebadf7","amp;dn":"Computational+Fluid+and+Solid+Mechanics+2003","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8d3d4c183d432068092b3f82d2aa83f37ebadf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,211,212,193,131,212,50,6,128,146,179,248,45,42,168,63,55,235,173,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
