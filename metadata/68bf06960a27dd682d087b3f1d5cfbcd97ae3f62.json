Delivery and controlled release systems are an essential way to achieve these aims. This important book reviews how to optimise these systems to maximise the health-promoting properties of food products.\r\n\r\nOpening chapters review factors affecting nutrient bioavailability and methods to test delivery system efficacy. Part two addresses materials used and specific techniques for delivery and release. The benefits and drawbacks of structured lipids, micro- and nano-emulsions, food-protein-derived materials, complexes and conjugates of biopolymers, and starch as an encapsulation material for delivery of functional food ingredients, are all considered. Part three discusses the delivery and controlled release of particular nutraceuticals such as antioxidants and vitamins, folic acid, probiotics, fish oils and proteins. Part four covers regulatory issues and future trends in bioactives and nutraceuticals.\r\n\r\nEdited by a leading expert in the field, Delivery and controlled release of bioactives in foods and nutraceuticals is a valuable reference for those working in the food industry and particularly those developing nutraceuticals.\r\n\r\nReviews techniques to optimise the delivery and release of bioactives in food\r\nDiscusses the factors that affect nutrient bioavailability and methods to test delivery system efficacy\r\nAddresses materials used and specific techniques for delivery and release","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68bf06960a27dd682d087b3f1d5cfbcd97ae3f62","amp;dn":"Delivery+and+Controlled+Release+of+Bioactives+in+Foods+and+Nutra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68bf06960a27dd682d087b3f1d5cfbcd97ae3f62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,191,6,150,10,39,221,104,45,8,123,63,29,92,251,205,151,174,63,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
