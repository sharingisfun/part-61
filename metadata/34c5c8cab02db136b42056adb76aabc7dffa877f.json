His work partakes of the freedom of form that was common to the early Baroque, when fantasias went by many names, and composers wrote down their celebrated improvisations to publish, later. This series of releases has Silvio Vartolo performing on harpsichord, organ, and a spinet, a smaller harpsichord usually meant for more intimate music-making.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
