(Wageningen, 2006).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-90-8686-010-4\r\n\r\nThis book contains over 300 offered papers in addition to 4 papers from invited speakers presented at the 52nd International Congress of Meat Science and Technology, held in Dublin, Ireland, from 13-18 August 2006. Under the theme of harnessing and exploiting global opportunities, areas covered in the congress included meat quality encompassing genomics and biotechnology, animal production and production systems, muscle biology and biochemistry; meat safety, meat processing and packaging technology, consumer topics and meat and health. A new approach this year was to address specific hot topics important to the industry and meat scientists, in particular, electrical stimulation and new instrumental methods for evaluation of meat quality characteristics. These proceedings reflect the truly global nature of meat research and give an insight into the current research issues for the industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f96add8600d6bf92e04d8d845b4fbff2a5b2244","amp;dn":"52nd+International+Congress+of+Meat+Science+and+Technology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f96add8600d6bf92e04d8d845b4fbff2a5b2244","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,150,173,216,96,13,107,249,46,4,216,216,69,180,251,255,42,91,34,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
