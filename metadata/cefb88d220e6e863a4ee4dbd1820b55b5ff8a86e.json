The assault began sometime during the past two days when two suicide bombers detonated a large amount of explosives on positions controlled by Bashar al Assadâ€™s regime and its Iranian-backed paramilitary allies.\r\n\r\nAl Nusrah, which is al Qaedaâ€™s official branch in Syria, has already released several videos of the fighting. A few of the videos were recorded using small drones, which captured the dramatic scenes from overhead. Al Nusrah claims that two of its â€œmartyrsâ€ killed more than 100 Shiite fighters in twin bombings. (Screen shots from the videos, along with other propaganda from the battle, can be seen below.)\r\n\r\nJaysh al Fateh seeks to expand its grip on the territory surrounding the town of Khan Tuman, which is located south of the city of Aleppo.\r\n \nhttp://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/06/al-nusrah-front-and-allies-launch-new-offensive-in-syrias-aleppo-province.php\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cefb88d220e6e863a4ee4dbd1820b55b5ff8a86e","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+AQ+Afghanistan+ISIS+Libya.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cefb88d220e6e863a4ee4dbd1820b55b5ff8a86e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,251,136,210,32,230,232,99,164,238,77,189,24,32,181,91,95,248,168,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
