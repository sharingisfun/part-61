Prasad (Wiley, 2003).pdf\r\n\r\nParas Prasadâ€™s text provides a basic knowledge of a broad range of topics so that individuals in all disciplines can rapidly acquire the minimal necessary background for research and development in biophotonics. Introduction to Biophotonics serves as both a textbook for education and training as well as a reference book that aids research and development of those areas integrating light, photonics, and biological systems. Each chapter contains a topic introduction, a review of key data, and description of future directions for technical innovation. Introduction to Biophotonics covers the basic principles of\r\nOptics\r\nOptical spectroscopy\r\nMicroscopy\r\nEach section also includes illustrated examples and review questions to test and advance the readerâ€™s knowledge. Sections on biosensors and chemosensors, important tools for combating biological and chemical terrorism, will be of particular interest to professionals in toxicology and other environmental disciplines. Introduction to Biophotonics proves a valuable reference for graduate students and researchers in engineering, chemistry, and the life sciences","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f0d1e01b13bc65f728c9caf97b0375a4cc2a19b","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Biophotonics+-+Paras+N.+Prasad","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f0d1e01b13bc65f728c9caf97b0375a4cc2a19b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,13,30,1,177,59,198,95,114,140,156,175,151,176,55,90,76,194,161,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
