The Vermont senator has been loathe to discuss exiting the race -- even raising the potential over the weekend of a contested convention -- but struck a more subdued note Monday.\r\n\r\n&quot;Let me just talk to you after the primary here in California, where we hope to win,&quot; Sanders told reporters at a news conference. &quot;Let's assess where we are after tomorrow before we make statements based on speculation.&quot;\r\n\r\nHe didn't once mention the word &quot;Philadelphia&quot; -- home of this year's Democratic convention -- during the news conference.\r\n\r\nBut amid clear signs that Democratic Party grandees are moving to shut down the campaign after Tuesday, a party source told CNN that President Barack Obama spoke to Sanders by phone on Tuesday. Two other Democratic sources, meanwhile, said the President is poised to deliver his endorsement of Clinton as early as this week.\r\n\r\nâ€œFor her part, Clinton focused on presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who is under fire for repeatedly accusing a judge overseeing a lawsuit involving Trump University of bias because of his Mexican heritage. Trump added to the controversy Sunday by saying he would have similar concerns if a Muslim judge supervised the case.\r\n\r\n&quot;I'm waiting for him to say because of all the bigoted things he has said about women that a woman judge couldn't preside,&quot; Clinton told a lunchtime crowd near Los Angeles. &quot;By the time he's finished, nobody's going to be left in this country that he is going to have exempted from insults.&quot;\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Clinton-Sanders battle is playing out far longer than most would have predicted at the beginning of the campaign season. With his critique of economic inequality, Sanders, a 74-year-old self-described democratic socialist, has become the unlikely hero of the young, progressive Democratic base. Still, Clinton is on the verge of the nomination after she dominated contests in the South and won large states including New York and Pennsylvaniaâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.cnn.com/2016/06/06/politics/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-california/\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f0b711e458f2b93a3a789a71cd4250bca6351a5","amp;dn":"Clinton+Vs+Trump+Begins+John+Batchelor.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f0b711e458f2b93a3a789a71cd4250bca6351a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,11,113,30,69,143,43,147,163,167,137,167,28,212,37,11,202,99,81,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
