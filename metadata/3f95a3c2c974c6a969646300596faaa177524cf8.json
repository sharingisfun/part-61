Schwertmann, R. M. Cornell (Wiley-VCH, 2000).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 3-527-29669-7\r\n\r\nIron Oxides play an important role in numerous disciplines. Since the publication of the first edition, there has been a surge of interest in synthetic fine to ultrafine iron oxides in a wide range of scientific and technological disciplines, especially in mineralogy, geosciences and environmental science and in various branches of technology. As before, the main aim of the second edition is to present reliable, well-tested, up-to-date methods of synthesizing pure iron oxides. The section on monodispersed particles, presently of great interest to industry, has been expanded. Furthermore the methods of characterization have been focused on their relevance to iron oxides. The well tried syntheses have been retained and some new ones have been incorporated","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f95a3c2c974c6a969646300596faaa177524cf8","amp;dn":"Iron+Oxides+in+the+Laboratory+-+Preparation+and+Characterization","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f95a3c2c974c6a969646300596faaa177524cf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,149,163,194,201,116,198,169,105,100,99,0,89,111,170,161,119,82,76,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
