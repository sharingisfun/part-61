And others found themselves wondering aloud what it would take â€” what Mr. Trump would have to say or do â€” for Republicans who have endorsed him to start jumping ship.\r\n\r\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, another former primary rival of Mr. Trumpâ€™s, urged Republicans who have backed Mr. Trump to rescind their endorsements, citing the remarks about Judge Curiel and â€œMr. Trumpâ€™s expression of doubt on Sunday that a Muslim judge could remain neutral in the same lawsuit, given Mr. Trumpâ€™s proposed ban on Muslim noncitizens entering the country.\r\n\r\nâ€œThis is the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,â€ Mr. Graham said. â€œIf anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,â€ Mr. Graham added. â€œThereâ€™ll come a time when the love of country will trump hatred of Hillary.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/us/politics/democrats-trump-presidential-race.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\r\n\r\n_________________\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦Curiel, 58, was one of two nominees whose nominations were approved before the Senate recessed.\r\n\r\nAnother 15 nominees already approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee are still awaiting confirmation votes, which will not occur until after the November elections.\r\n\r\nCurielâ€™s was one of several seats designated as a judicial emergency by the federal court administration. The designation is based on an excessive number of filings per judgeship in a federal district.\r\n\r\nâ€œSan Diego is one of the nationâ€™s busiest federal courts. The district, which includes Imperial County, had 9,254 case filings in 2011. Of those, 5,873 were criminal case filings, making it the nationâ€™s fourth busiest in terms of criminal caseload in 2011. The district has 13 judges.\r\n\r\nâ€œCuriel was appointed to the state bench in 2006, after a career serving as a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles and San Diego beginning in 1989.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2012/sep/25/judge-curiel-gets-seat-on-federal-bench/\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daa698d9ef3067004bdc250cd38c62d8deb514d7","amp;dn":"john+batchelor+GOP+Recoils+Trump.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daa698d9ef3067004bdc250cd38c62d8deb514d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,166,152,217,239,48,103,0,75,220,37,12,211,140,98,216,222,181,20,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
