I messed up on my previous torrent for this same exact torrent and the activator, Rufus tool and the 2 txt files would not download. I added this torrent with all of it working. So for those that got to 99.8% and it stopped from the other torrent, download everything but the .ISO file.\r\n\r\nUntouched ISO made from the update ESD. English only.\r\nNothing added/nothing deleted.\r\n\r\nThis was created by using the update.esd file and using an ESD Decrypter to create the .iso. It is has no frills, nothing adding nor nothing changed. Just check the box that says you do not have a key then you have 3 days to use whatever method you want to activate.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Toolkit 2.6 Beta 5 is included for activation but you can use any other method as well.\r\n\r\nInstall Notes\r\n1: Use Rufus to create a bootable .iso from the image &quot;en_windows_10_pro_14361_x64_dvd.iso&quot; onto a thumbdrive or use any DVD authoring software capable of creating a bootable .iso from the &quot;en_windows_10_pro_14361_x64_dvd.iso&quot; file.\r\n2: You may have to change your first boot device to the thumdrive or DVD drive in your BIOS/UEFI.\r\n3: When asked for a key just check the box that says &quot;I do not have a key&quot; and it will continue the installation.\r\n4: You then have 3 days to activate using whichever method you choose. I have included the &quot;Microsoft Toolkit 2.6 Beta 5.exe&quot; in the &quot;Activator&quot; folder but you can use any activation method of your choice.\r\n5: If you choose to use the Microsoft Toolkit, run it as administrator and click the Windows Colored Flag in the bottom right corner right next to the &quot;Settings&quot; button.\r\n6: Click the &quot;Activation&quot; tab and leave the drop down box as &quot;AutoKMS&quot; and click the &quot;Install&quot; button. It may take a few seconds or a couple minutes. Once it says complete, click the &quot;EZ-Activator&quot; button and let it finish.\r\n\r\nYou will then be activated. This tool can be used to activate almost all versions of Office as well by clicking the other button in the bottom right. The button to the left of the windows flag button","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:180e91d77649055eb98aa4fa8e0baec92bbec2d6","amp;dn":"Windows+10+Pro+Redstone+Insider+Preview_1511_14361_EN-US_Untouch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"180e91d77649055eb98aa4fa8e0baec92bbec2d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,14,145,215,118,73,5,94,185,138,164,250,142,11,174,201,43,190,194,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
