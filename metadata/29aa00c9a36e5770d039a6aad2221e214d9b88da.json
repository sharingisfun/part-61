Hotel Mars: David Livingston, Doug Messier\r\n\r\nJohn Batchelor mp3 Podcast\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦Mr. Sanders made plans to lay off most of his campaign staff, yet he appeared reluctant to let go completely after months of political warfare against a Clinton machine that he holds in thinly veiled contempt. With six states voting on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders was holding out hope for a huge upset in the California primary to justify staying in the race and lobbying Democratic officials to support him in a contested convention next month.\r\n\r\nâ€œMontana, New Mexico and the Dakotas also held Democratic contests on Tuesday. Republicans voted in several states, although Mr. Trump became the presumptive nominee in early May.\r\n\r\nâ€œAs Mrs. Clinton sought to turn her attention to the general election, Mr. Trump, who had a weekslong head start, was busy reckoning with problems of his own making. His criticism of a federal judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel, for the judgeâ€™s Mexican heritage continued to inflict damage on his campaign, as the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, called Mr. Trumpâ€™s remarks racist and other Republicans piled on criticism. One Republican senator rescinded his support.\r\n\r\nâ€œMr. Trump, speaking to supporters in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., pledged to make Republicans â€œproud of our party and our movement,â€ though he did not try to defuse the controversy. Instead, reading carefully from a teleprompter, he mounted a lengthy attack on Mrs. Clintonâ€™s record, saying she had â€œturned the State Department into her private hedge fund.â€ And he explicitly reached out to Sanders supporters who he said had been â€œleft out in the cold by a rigged system.â€â€¦â€\r\n \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/us/politics/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-primary.html\r\n \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-wins-the-media-primary-1465322924\r\n \nhttp://spacenews.com/xcor-lays-off-employees-to-focus-on-engine-development/\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29aa00c9a36e5770d039a6aad2221e214d9b88da","amp;dn":"HRC+Prevails+John+Batchelor.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29aa00c9a36e5770d039a6aad2221e214d9b88da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,170,0,201,163,110,87,112,208,57,166,170,210,34,30,33,77,155,136,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
