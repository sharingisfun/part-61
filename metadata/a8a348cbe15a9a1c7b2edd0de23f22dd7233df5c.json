Warrin has it all: a popular pianist who plays any style, he has money, great clothes, a penthouse overlooking Central Park, a rich blond fiancÃ©e, a loyal brunette secretary secretly in love with him, and a date at Carnegie Hall. \r\nOn concert night, an illness deafens him. While medical science works on a cure, he must find other ventures. He learns lip reading and, using high-powered binoculars, eavesdrops on conversations in the park. When he finds people in need, he plays God, interceding with help. Meanwhile, his fiancÃ©e is falling in love with another man, his secretary quits, and his doctors give him new hope. Carnegie Hall and true love may be within reach.\r\n\r\nFeaturing:\r\nLiberace \t\tas Anthony Warrin\r\nJoanne Dru \tas Marion Moore\r\nDorothy Malone \tas Linda Curtis\r\nWilliam Demarest \tas Sam Dunne\r\nRichard Eyer \tas Alvie\r\nLurene Tuttle \tas Mrs. McGinley\r\nAlex Nicol \tas Howard\r\n\r\nDirected by Gordon Douglas\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLength: \t115 minutes\r\nFormat:\t16:9\r\nAudio:\tStereo 192 kbps\r\nDefinition\t1280x720 (upscaled from DVD)\r\n\r\nRipped by KiwiKid","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8a348cbe15a9a1c7b2edd0de23f22dd7233df5c","amp;dn":"Sincerely+Yours+%281955%29+-+Liberace+-+DVDrip+KiwiKid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8a348cbe15a9a1c7b2edd0de23f22dd7233df5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,163,72,203,225,90,154,28,123,46,221,13,226,63,34,221,114,51,223,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
