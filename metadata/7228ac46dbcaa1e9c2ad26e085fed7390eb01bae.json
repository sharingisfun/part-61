She gave it her best shot Thursday with what was billed as a major foreign policy speech. I'll save you the effort to read the transcript. She said in essence, nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrump is Resurrecting the 'Great Silent Majority'\r\nMonica Crowley - Washington Times\r\nIn late October 1969, Richard Nixon took out one of his famous yellow legal pads to jot down some thoughts. The new president was faced with serious global and domestic turmoil. The Soviet Union had initiated a nuclear buildup, the Middle East was aflame (some things never change), and the war in Vietnam raged on. At home, the war drove hundreds of thousands of protesters into the streets, convulsing a nation already seething from the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. and a growing countercultural movement.\r\n\r\nWhy Black Voters Should Support Donald Trump\r\nJohn Gibbs - The Federalist\r\nAs an American who is black, I'm supposed to hate Donald Trump. They say he's a racist demagogue. They say he hates Mexicans. They say he hates women. They say he's mean. Yes, I've heard it all. But I believe that above all the sensationalist name-calling, there is a strong case for black support for \r\n\r\nA Party Divided, and None Too Soon\r\nPeggy Noonan - Wall Street Journal\r\nThis first month of summer I see movement and no-movement. No movement: Donald Trump. He's like someone caught in the first act who lurches into a second act-a solid, prepared speech, a subdued interview-then scrambles back to first-act antics. It's easy to guess he's surrounded by friends and supporters who know more is needed than popping off about &quot;Crooked Hillary&quot; but are afraid to mess with his swing.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Word of Advice for Hillary Clinton\r\nClive Crook - Bloomberg\r\nThe secret of success, somebody once said, is sincerity: If you can fake that, you've got it made. This is the crux of Hillary Clinton's likeability problem. It isn't just that she can't fake sincerity, though that's bad enough if you want to succeed in politics; it's that she can't seem sincere even when she is. \nhttp://www.lauraingraham.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7228ac46dbcaa1e9c2ad26e085fed7390eb01bae","amp;dn":"The+Laura+Ingrham+Podcast+June+3+2016.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7228ac46dbcaa1e9c2ad26e085fed7390eb01bae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,40,172,70,219,202,161,233,194,173,38,224,133,254,215,57,14,176,27,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
