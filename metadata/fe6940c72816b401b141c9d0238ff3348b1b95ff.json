Disputes in the South China Sea are expected to head the agenda of the three-day event, which starts on Fridayâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1960954/beijing-ready-impose-air-defence-identification-zone-south-china-sea?utm_source=The%20Sinocism%20China%20Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=3d3bda0cb5-Sinocism05_31_165_31_2016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_171f237867-3d3bda0cb5-29635437&amp;mc_cid=3d3bda0cb5&amp;mc_eid=57f0936f67\r\n\r\nâ€œRoiling tensions in the South China Sea are set to dominate Asia's biggest security summit starting in Singapore on Friday, exposing a deepening rivalry between the United States and China ahead of a landmark legal ruling in the Hague.\r\n\r\nThe unofficial Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD) is the last chance for the two powers to drum up support before a decision from the Permanent Court of Arbitration in a case brought by the Philippines.\r\n\r\nManila is contesting Beijing's claim to an area shown on its maps as nine-dash line stretching deep into the maritime heart of Southeast Asia, covering hundreds disputed islands and reefs.\r\n\r\nSecurity experts expect the United States will try to convince Southeast Asian countries, as well as other big powers such as India and Japan, to publicly support any positive decision for the Philippines, who asked the court to recognize its right to exploit waters in the South China Sea.\r\n\r\nChina, which rejects the court's authority, will try to sway the countries to abstain from taking a public position, which should make it easier to stave off criticism from the West.\r\n\r\n&quot;The value of the case is the long term reputational damage and the pressure ... on the Chinese.
