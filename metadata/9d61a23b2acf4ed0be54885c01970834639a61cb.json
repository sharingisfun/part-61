Feldheim, Colby A. Foss, Jr (Marcel Dekker, 2002).pdf\r\n\r\nA state-of-the-art reference, Metal Nanoparticles offers the latest research on the synthesis, characterization, and applications of nanoparticles. Following an introduction of structural, optical, electronic, and electrochemical properties of nanoparticles, the book elaborates on nanoclusters, hyper-Raleigh scattering, nanoarrays, and several applications including single electron devices, chemical sensors, biomolecule sensors, and DNA detection. The text emphasizes how size, shape, and surface chemistry affect particle performance throughout.\r\n\r\nTopics include synthesis and formation of nanoclusters, nanosphere lithography, modeling of nanoparticle optical properties, and biomolecule sensors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d61a23b2acf4ed0be54885c01970834639a61cb","amp;dn":"Metal+Nanoparticles+-+Synthesis%2C+Characterization%2C+and+Applicati","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d61a23b2acf4ed0be54885c01970834639a61cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,97,162,59,42,207,78,208,190,84,136,92,1,151,8,52,99,154,97,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
