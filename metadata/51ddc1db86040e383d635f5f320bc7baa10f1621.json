Available in both 32 and 64 bit versions\r\n\r\nEase of use\r\nAs far as possible, Opus works just like Explorer does. You don't have to learn any complicated scripting or non-standard mouse techniques to use Opus. If you've ever used Explorer to copy a file, you already know exactly how to do it in Opus as well.\r\n\r\nConfigurability\r\nWe believe in the user's right to choose how their computer operates. You'll find that almost every aspect of Opus can be changed - from the buttons on the toolbar to the color used to draw the background of a compressed file.\r\n\r\nEfficiency\r\nOpus is designed to be as efficient as possible. The entire program makes use of multi-threading to ensure that you should never have to wait for one operation to complete before beginning another.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\nAs an Explorer Replacement it's important that Opus appears (to the system) just like Explorer does. Within the limits set by Microsoft, Opus achieves this and most software written with only Explorer in mind will still work fine with Opus installed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51ddc1db86040e383d635f5f320bc7baa10f1621","amp;dn":"%E2%80%ABDirectory+Opus+Pro_+11.19+Build+6005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51ddc1db86040e383d635f5f320bc7baa10f1621","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,221,193,219,134,4,14,56,61,99,95,95,50,11,199,186,161,15,22,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
