After trailing Hillary Clinton by five points for the prior two weeks, Donald Trump has now taken a four-point lead.\r\n\r\nThe latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey of Likely U.S. Voters finds Trump with 43% of the vote, while Clinton earns 39%. Twelve percent (12%) still like another candidate, and five percent (5%) are undecided. (To see survey question wording, click here.)\r\n\r\nLast week at this time, it was Clinton 44%, Trump 39%. This is Trumpâ€™s highest level of support in Rasmussen Reportsâ€™ matchups with Clinton since last October. His support has been hovering around the 40% mark since April, but it remains to be seen whether heâ€™s just having a good week or this actually represents a real move forward among voters.\r\n\r\n Blue Cross, Health Net drop Obamacare plans\r\nTwo major health insurance companies, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona and Health Net, will drop Affordable Care Act plans next year in Maricopa and Pinal counties, forcing tens of thousands of consumers to switch plans next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Who will show up? Who will pay? The many unknowns of the GOP convention.\r\nDozens of well-known Republicans aren't showing up. There's no word yet on who will speak. A growing number of corporate sponsors are taking a pass. Groups of white supremacists and other agitators are on the way, while the official protest routes are frantically being redrawn after being thrown out in court. And then there's the fight to dethrone the big star.\r\n\r\nLike Mitt who cares ????\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the 1964 Presidential election, Governor George Romney was part of an effort to stop Senator Barry Goldwater from winning the Republican Partyâ€™s nomination.\r\n\r\nToday, his son Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 nominee for the presidency, has emerged as a leading establishment critic of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. On Wednesday, he reiterated that he will not vote Trump due to defects in Trumpâ€™s character and a belief that Trump is destroying the GOPâ€™s future with women, Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans, and millenials. Neither will Romney vote for Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s a matter of personal conscience,â€ he said. â€œI canâ€™t vote for either of those two people.â€ He suggested that he would write in his wifeâ€™s nameâ€“â€“she would be â€œan ideal president,â€ he saidâ€“â€“or he would cast his ballot for a third-party candidate.\r\n\r\nN American leaders vow to boost trade despite threats\r\n\r\nCanada, the United States and Mexico on Wednesday mounted a fierce defense of free trade, vowing to deepen economic ties despite an increasingly acrimonious debate about the value of globalization.\r\n\r\nU.S. President Barack Obama and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto also took swipes at U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has vowed to renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) if he wins November's election.\r\n\r\n&quot;The integration of national economies into a global economy: that's here, that's done,&quot; Obama told a news conference at the end of a summit dubbed the &quot;Three Amigos&quot;.\r\n\r\nPresident Obama went off on his own rant Wednesday at a trilateral press conference in which he disputed the idea that Donald Trump is a populist and that the presumptive GOP nominee instead promotes &quot;nativism&quot; or &quot;xenophobia.&quot;\r\n\r\nAfter reporters asked a series of questions of Mr. Obama, Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Mr. Obama decided he had something else to say in Ottawa -- he addressed the common theme of populism raised during the event.\r\n\r\n&quot;I'm not prepared to concede the notion that some of the rhetoric that's been popping up is populist,&quot; Mr. Obama said, referring to Trump.\r\n\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.lauraingraham.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bef25c0448ea2e45370f454f8b327e266478b658","amp;dn":"The-Laura-Ingraham-Show-Podcast+June+30+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bef25c0448ea2e45370f454f8b327e266478b658","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,242,92,4,72,234,46,69,55,15,69,79,139,50,126,38,100,120,182,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
