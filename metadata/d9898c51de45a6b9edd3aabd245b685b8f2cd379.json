He also wrote a great deal of chamber and sacred music. Rubbra's works went into eclipse in the 60s and 70s, as the BBC management pushed British serialists to garner musical attention abroad, but he lived long enough to see the critical tide reverse itself, and respect return for at least some of his life's work.\r\n\r\nHis Fourth Symphony was composed after Rubbra had joined the war effort--in fact, he had to beg for time to complete its orchestation, and ran into difficulties with being allowed to conduct. It shows the composer on the cusp of achieving his own distinctive voice, and his remarkable sense of structure that lies outside the mainstream of statement-development into something more like the Renaissance fantasias he so enjoyed.\r\n\r\nTwo bios enclosed.\r\n\r\nYou can find my classical uploads by searching on Philidor, or checking this thread:\r\n \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Philidor-s-uploads--63895","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9898c51de45a6b9edd3aabd245b685b8f2cd379","amp;dn":"Rubbra+-+Sym+%234+-+R+Hickox%2C+BBC+Nat+O+of+Wales+%281994%29+%5BPhilidor%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9898c51de45a6b9edd3aabd245b685b8f2cd379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,137,140,81,222,69,166,185,237,211,170,189,36,91,104,91,143,44,211,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
