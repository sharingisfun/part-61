This is their first release, original on a 7&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there are only two tracks on here Corrections House finds a way to create a bleak and apocalyptic landscape within it's twelve minutes of play. Starting this Ep is the groups first single &quot;Hoax The System&quot; with it's sharp piercing drone lasting for the first 20 seconds until a single drum beat kicks in alongside Scott Kelly's slow moving guitar chords which are then followed by Mike IX's shouting of lyrics in a spoken word famous which almost sounds like Mike is standing on a podium in a town square yelling to a crowd of people demanding they revolt. The second and final track to this 7&quot; is the track &quot;Grin with a purpose&quot; which is much more bleak and barren compared to it's predecessor with Sanford's effects of clanging metal and almost factory sounding effects and Scott's guitar slowly ringing out until the tempo picks up and Mike's vocals kick into a straight up spoken word piece along side Bruce Lamont's vocal and saxophone effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1. Hoax the System\r\n2.
