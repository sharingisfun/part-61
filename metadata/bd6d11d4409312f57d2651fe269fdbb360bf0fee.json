No one will hire her for her magic talents until she's got the credentials, so she's stuck in a crappy rent controlled apartment with her mother, yearning for treats she can't afford at her part time job in a cafe, counting down the days until she graduates the secret Blackhollow Academy school for magi. Only then will she have the certificate she needs to land her dream job in a coven. \r\n\r\nThe problem? She needs a familiar to graduate. \r\n\r\nAs an illusionist, she doesn't have the ability to summon or create a familiar of her own. Her only option is to convince a supernatural creature to let her bind it instead. Since having a powerful Other at her beck and call would guarantee her a place in a coven after she graduatesâ€”and legendary treasure hoards are an added bonusâ€”she thinks binding a dragon as her familiar will solve all her problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd6d11d4409312f57d2651fe269fdbb360bf0fee","amp;dn":"Smoke+and+Mirrors+-+%7BCHB+Books%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd6d11d4409312f57d2651fe269fdbb360bf0fee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,109,17,212,64,147,18,245,125,38,81,254,38,159,219,179,96,191,15,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
