When Lonberg-Holm and Falzone play long notes over a Daisy's\r\nbusy (but relaxed!) marimba in perfect counterpoint, the sublime becomes\r\ntranscendent.  There is a hilarious perversion of the Braxton composition model\r\nat the beginning of â€œObjects,â€ that involves tweaks in the time/space\r\ncontinuum.  Daisy seems to be dangling Fred and James from strings, forcing\r\nthem in different directions and then suddenly bringing them back together\r\nsolely through the intuitive will of his drumming.  â€œContainedâ€ demonstrates\r\neven more clearly that this group can play as one six-armed machine, with\r\nbrilliant unhurried statements made by all, collectively and individually.\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nPor Sergio Piccirilli (es) \nhttp://elintruso.com/2015/08/23/vox-arcana-caros-song/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b224ac743ed058de61294eab54e95eb0cd4a286a","amp;dn":"Vox+Arcana+-+Caro%27s+Song+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b224ac743ed058de61294eab54e95eb0cd4a286a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,36,172,116,62,208,88,222,97,41,78,171,84,233,94,176,205,74,40,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
