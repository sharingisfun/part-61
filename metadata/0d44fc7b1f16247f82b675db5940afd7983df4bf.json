The first was an orchestral commission; the second, one from the BBC. In both cases, Rubbra demonstrated his lyric and transformative gifts, as well as his late ability to state everything he wanted to say with a minium of excessive gesture. He himself declared that all his symphonies were in Eleventh.\r\n\r\nTwo bios enclosed. All transfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nYou can find all my classical uploads by searching on Philidor, or just looking in this regularly updated thread:\r\n \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Philidor-s-uploads--63895","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d44fc7b1f16247f82b675db5940afd7983df4bf","amp;dn":"Rubbra+-+Sym+%2310%2C+11+-+R+Hickox%2C+BBC+Nat+O+of+Wales+%5BPhilidor%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d44fc7b1f16247f82b675db5940afd7983df4bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,68,252,123,31,22,36,127,130,182,117,219,89,64,175,215,152,61,244,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
