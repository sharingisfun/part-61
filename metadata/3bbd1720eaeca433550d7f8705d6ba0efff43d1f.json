Lengthy protests from abroad at his being denied a visa eventually worked, and he was expecting to travel to France (where he'd initially studied composition), when he died suddenly in 1963. A prolific composer of both symphonies and string quartets, his musical style changed and softened over time, though his attitude towards the government never did.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nA bio is enclosed.
