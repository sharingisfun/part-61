The first part of the book highlights general properties of and phenomena observed with nanoparticles, and the subsequent consequences for applications in drug delivery. The second part focuses on the therapeutic approaches that are possible through the use of nanoparticles, with each chapter discussing a specific disease (e.g., diabetes, cancer, inflammation) and the relevant therapeutic approaches based on the design of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems. From this concise book, readers will gain an insight into the basics of nanoparticle preparation and find a more detailed account of what is therapeutically feasible by using nanoparticle approaches","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bc6e2efef9b74f13d641c5c4b0de612267f799e","amp;dn":"Nanotherapeutics+-+Drug+Delivery+Concepts+in+Nanoscience","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bc6e2efef9b74f13d641c5c4b0de612267f799e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,198,226,239,239,155,116,241,61,100,28,92,75,13,230,18,38,127,121,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
