As such, he met with great resistance from critics and audiences in his final years, and definitely contributed to his growing reliance on alcohol. His Third Symphony dates from this period, around 1926. It's a pastoral, transparent, poised and dance-like work, which perplexed audiences at the time. As French writer Henri-Claude FantapiÃ© was to state years later, &quot;The listeners expected the opera [The Ostrobothnians] to be followed by a nationalistic anthem, and were disappointed to hear something that seemed to them to be hermetic and that, to crown it all, was lacking in pomposity and solemnity.&quot; Today,  it is considered Madetoja's masterpiece, along with the haunting ballet, Okon Fuoko, about a magician's creations that come to life, killing their creator.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
