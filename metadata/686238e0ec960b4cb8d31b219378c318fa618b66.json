I have my own recording studio and along with this comes the possibility of creating multi-layered music sounding a bit larger than life. I love this setup but for a change I felt inspired to make a recording of music that captures the way we sound when we play live. I've enlisted my favorite players and we brought our long list of experiences both musical and humanistic into the studio. In the span of two days we documented this experience into the digital realm. And now, Taking It All In is complete and it joins the family of jazz CD's that I've created over the years. The early recordings (Dance Of The Universe, The Path, Bird Raga, Message Sent On The Wind, Musica Del Mar, and Na Pali Coast) set the stage and mapped out the roots, and now Taking It All In sheds the light of the new millennium onto my view of an acoustic jazz quartet digging into some improvisation. I hope it sounds good to you...\r\n\r\nPeter Sprague\r\nAugust 2005\r\n\r\nThe musicians on the CD are:\r\nPeter Sprague - guitar\r\nTripp Sprague - saxophone and flute\r\nBob Magnusson - bass\r\nDuncan Moore - drums\r\nSongs\r\n\r\nTaking It All In - 7:36 - Peter Sprague (Satyam Music / BMI)\r\nShinobi - 6:23 - Peter Sprague (Satyam Music / BMI)\r\nZen Joao - 7:33 - Peter Sprague (Satyam Music / BMI)\r\nUnmarketable Math - 7:11 - Peter Sprague (Satyam Music / BMI)\r\nTravels - 6:18 - Pat Metheny\r\nAcid Peter - 5:59 - Peter Sprague (Satyam Music / BMI)\r\nJoe Farrell - 7:03 - Peter Sprague (Satyam Music / BMI)\r\nCalling Me Home - 6:36 - Peter Sprague (Satyam Music / BMI)\r\nAlien I.Q. - 7:44 - Peter Sprague (Satyam Music / BMI)\r\nKundalini - 7:35 - Peter Sprague (Satyam Music / BMI)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:686238e0ec960b4cb8d31b219378c318fa618b66","amp;dn":"Taking+It+All+In","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"686238e0ec960b4cb8d31b219378c318fa618b66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,98,56,224,236,150,11,76,184,211,27,33,147,120,195,24,250,97,139,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
