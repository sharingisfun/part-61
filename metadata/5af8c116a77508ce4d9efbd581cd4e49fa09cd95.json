The graphics are identical with the one on\r\n                Spectrum or C64.  A level editor is also provided.  This version\r\n                has 300 levels from the original game and there can be more\r\n                than 2000 levels.\r\n\r\nI claim no copyrights.  My interest is preservation.  To that end, I present a\r\ngit repo, which starts at the original 1.0-b6 sources, and respectfully brings\r\nit forward.  My releases will be named &quot;boulderdash-$VER.mit&quot;.  When I release a\r\nnew seed, please stop seeding the old and start seeding the new.  I will not\r\nrewrite git history, so nothing will be lost by moving your seed forward","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5af8c116a77508ce4d9efbd581cd4e49fa09cd95","amp;dn":"boulderdash-1.0-b7-mit.tar.gz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5af8c116a77508ce4d9efbd581cd4e49fa09cd95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,248,193,22,167,117,8,206,77,158,251,213,129,205,78,73,250,9,205,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
