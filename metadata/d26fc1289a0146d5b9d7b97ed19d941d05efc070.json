The structures considered are nanowires, nanorods, hybrid semiconductor nanostructures, wide bandgap nanostructures for visible light emitters and graphene. The device applications of these structures are broadly explained. The book deals also with the characterization of semiconductor nanostructures. It appeals to researchers and graduate students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d26fc1289a0146d5b9d7b97ed19d941d05efc070","amp;dn":"Semiconductor+Nanostructures+for+Optoelectronic+Devices","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d26fc1289a0146d5b9d7b97ed19d941d05efc070","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,111,193,40,154,1,70,213,185,215,185,126,209,157,148,29,5,239,192,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
