Morris (Springer, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nNanotechnologies are being applied to microelectronics packaging, primarily in the applications of nanoparticle nanocomposites, or in the exploitation of the superior mechanical, electrical, or thermal properties of carbon nanotubes. Composite materials are studied for high-k dielectrics, resistors and inductors, electrically conductive adhesives, conductive â€œinks,â€ underfill fillers, and solder enhancement. â€œNanopackagingâ€ is intended for industrial and academic researchers, industrial electronics packaging engineers who need to keep abreast of their field, and others with interests in nanotechnology. It will survey the application of nanotechnologies to electronics packaging, as represented by current research across the field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf91f50d2e6a382f1b7111f772d50a7143b53b18","amp;dn":"Nanopackaging+-+Nanotechnologies+and+Electronics+Packaging","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf91f50d2e6a382f1b7111f772d50a7143b53b18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,145,245,13,46,106,56,47,27,113,17,247,114,213,10,113,67,181,59,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
