Written principally for solid state physicists and chemists, materials scientists, and plasma physicists, the book concludes with the outlook for such applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f92306f15f7f2812c24ca00fbda8db2b0dccd12","amp;dn":"Plasma-Aided+Nanofabrication","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f92306f15f7f2812c24ca00fbda8db2b0dccd12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,146,48,111,21,247,242,129,44,36,202,0,251,218,141,178,176,220,205,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
