Take on the role of Mike; who is in the woods with his daughter, fleeing from an attacking wave of zombies. During the escape, Mike slips, falls and loses consciousness. He awakes to find that Adele is nowhere to be found. His only chance in finding her is to follow the signs. \r\n\r\nAdele: Following the Signs is the result of over 2 years of hard work from the people at Unosquare Labs. It is an extremely challenging 2.5D puzzle-platform strategy game with beautiful graphics, original art and music, and interesting game play written by Unosquare. Special guest music composer coming soon! \r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES: \r\n19 challenging levels \r\nZombies, attacking Plants and Monster Bosses \r\nA special bonus for those who can pass each level without dying \r\nEnemies and obstacles that will require both brains and skill to overcome\r\n\r\nAdele is not meant to be a zombie killing game. Players have to strategically maneuver objects to block their path, run away or trap zombies into falling in order to escape them. The game is set in different environments which impact your interaction with the zombies, being in a factory is going to be different than in the countryside, or underground[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=blue]MINIMUM: \r\nOS: Windows 7 (32-bit) \r\nProcessor: intel i5 (or equivalent) \r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: 1GB NVIDIA or AMD graphics card \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0 \r\nStorage: 5 GB available space.[/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1231.photobucket.com/albums/ee501/Indo_Hd/bcedgfhk.gif[/img]\r\n\r\n[i][b][color=orange]Screenshots-:[/color][/b][/i]\r\n\r\n[img]http://cdn.steamstatic.com.8686c.com/steam/apps/457980/ss_a3314a106e4e3056d8116e4a4fa871321ffd8385.600x338.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://cdn.steamstatic.com.8686c.com/steam/apps/457980/ss_d6067cf40aa32b6e0ce39fa90a23bcbaf04bbeba.600x338.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1231.photobucket.com/albums/ee501/Indo_Hd/bcedgfhk.gif[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/DgpeTWf.gif[/img]\r\n[color=blue][b]Release Notes:- I aM trying to do MY best... so If you want to thank ME..Just Seed MY torrents and do comments on MY uploads...[/b].[/color]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/DgpeTWf.gif[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://yuq.me/users/22/474/5Ue4vgtzn2.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/W3abX.gif[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://img607.imageshack.us/img607/8831/q9e4.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/2315/zfx.gif[/img][/b][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28c6a990290a63ac90612c8903fda3549406b97d","amp;dn":"Adele%3A+Following+the+Signs-+CODEX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28c6a990290a63ac90612c8903fda3549406b97d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,198,169,144,41,10,99,172,144,97,44,137,3,253,163,84,148,6,185,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
