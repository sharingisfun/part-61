(Wiley, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-118-60525-7\r\n\r\nBiocatalysts are increasingly used by chemists engaged in fine chemical synthesis within both industry and academia. Today, there exists a huge choice of high-tech enzymes and whole cell biocatalysts, which add enormously to the repertoire of synthetic possibilities.\r\n\r\nPractical Methods for Biocatalysis and Biotransformations 3 will be a companion book to Practical Methods for Biocatalysis and Biotransformations (2009) and Practical Methods for Biocatalysis and Biotransformations 2 (2012). Following the successful format of the two volumes, it will be a â€œhow-toâ€ guide focusing on commercially available enzymes and strains of microorganisms that are readily obtained from culture collections. The source of starting materials and reagents, hints, tips and safety advice (where appropriate) will be given to ensure, as far as possible, that the procedures are reproducible. Comparisons to alternative methodology will be given and relevant references to the primary literature will be cited.\r\n\r\nContents include:\r\n\r\nBiotransformation Process Technology\r\nIndustrial Biooxidation\r\nHydrolase catalysed hydrolysis/synthesis\r\nReduction\r\nOxidation\r\nHalogenation\r\nTransferase catalysed glycosylation, methylation, etc\r\nC-C bond formation\r\nTandem Biocatalytic Reactions\r\n\r\nPractical Methods for Biocatalysis and Biotransformations, Volume 3 is an essential collection of validated biocatalytic methods which will find a place on the bookshelves of synthetic organic chemists, pharmaceutical chemists, and process R&amp;D chemists in industry and academia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e99377d5c74941aac1156544e5fbad23d474500","amp;dn":"Practical+Methods+for+Biocatalysis+and+Biotransformations+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e99377d5c74941aac1156544e5fbad23d474500","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,153,55,125,92,116,148,26,172,17,86,84,78,95,186,210,61,71,69,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
