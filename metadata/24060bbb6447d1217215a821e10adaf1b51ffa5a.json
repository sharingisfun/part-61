Included images of the album jacket and the vinyl center labels. \r\n\r\nI listened to a 1988 CD reissue on BMG [Catalog # 1150-2-RC], and it sounded too different to me.\r\nThere were added songs, and one song out of sequence. \r\n\r\nI want as close to the same experience, on a computer or CD, that I had when I listened to this album on vinyl, over and over, in 1970 when I was 15 years old.\r\nTo me, these ripped tracks sound superior to the re-mastered CD I heard, and the pops and the warmth of the sound of vinyl are priceless.\r\n\r\nTo listen like a vinyl album, load all the Side 1 tracks and play, then get out of your seat, and like turning over the album back in the day, load the Side 2 tracks and cool out.\r\n(Alternately, play in Winamp, load up Milkdrop, and trip out)\r\n\r\nWhen you burn to CD, select Ã¬no pause between tracksÃ® for the total vinyl experience.\r\n\r\nRipped from the original 1968 vinyl to FLAC. \r\n(Stanton STR8-30 Direct Drive Turntable, Onkyo TX-8011 Stereo Receiver, M-Audio MobilePre USB, Nero WaveEditor, no filters used)\r\n\r\nS1-T01 Aquarius.flac\r\nS1-T02-03 Donna/Hashish.flac\r\nS1-T04 Sodomy.flac\r\nS1-T05 Colored Spade.flac\r\nS1-T06 Manchester England.flac\r\nS1-T07-08 I'm Black/Ain't Got No.flac\r\nS1-T09 Air.flac\r\nS1-T10 Initials.flac\r\nS1-T11 I Got Life.flac\r\nS1-T12 Hair.flac\r\nS1-T13 My Conviction.flac\r\nS1-T14 Don't Put It Down.flac\r\nS1-T15 Frank Mills.flac\r\nS1-T16 Be-In.flac\r\nS2-T01 Where Do I Go.flac\r\nS2-T02 Black Boys.flac\r\nS2-T03 White\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24060bbb6447d1217215a821e10adaf1b51ffa5a","amp;dn":"Hair+-+Original+broadway+cast+1968+RCA+Victor+release","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24060bbb6447d1217215a821e10adaf1b51ffa5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,6,11,187,100,71,209,33,114,21,168,33,225,10,218,241,181,31,250,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
