The film assembles archival footage, animations and narration. Released online on June 18, 2007, it soon received tens of millions of views on Google Video, YouTube, and Vimeo. According to Peter Joseph, the original Zeitgeist was not presented in a film format, but was a &quot;performance piece consisting of a vaudevillian, multimedia style event using recorded music, live instruments, and video&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTop Five â€œZeitgeist The Movieâ€ Myths!\r\n\r\n\r\n1) The Zeitgeist Movement is all about support of Zeitgeist: The Movie!\r\n\r\nActually, as per my experience over the past 6 years, most within The Zeitgeist Movement (TZM) do not subscribe or agree with this film in general, although mixed reactions are most common. Zeitgeist: The Movie was created years before TZM was formed. TZM was created originally to support Jacque Frescoâ€™s Venus Project (TVP). After TVP and TZM split three years later, TZM became a self-propelling institution with its own body of work. The text â€œThe Zeitgeist Movement Definedâ€ is the core source of Movement interests and expresses what TZM is about clearly.\r\n\r\nAs of 2015, any ongoing association with TZM and Zeitgeist: The Movie is often perpetuated by those merely with malicious intent. As the rest of this list will express, Zeitgeist: The Movie has been a point of extreme attack and bigoted reactions since its inception. Having been seen by literally hundreds of millions of people, it is no surprise so many in vehement disagreement rise to the top. I wish I counted the number of death threats and the amount of cyber stalking I have personally endured. I have spent upwards of $20,000 in legal fees fighting constant defamation by those offended by that film.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, many have suggested that a simple name change (remove â€œZeitgeistâ€) would have solved the problem. Yet, if a name change alone is that persuasive, isnâ€™t that actually indicative of a deep lack of critical thought? Where a mere superficial title changes peopleâ€™s sense of association? I find this troubling if so. But regardless, the genie cannot go back in the bottle. Love it or hate it, Zeitgeist: The Movie isnâ€™t going anywhere and its content/implications 8 years later seem to only get stronger and more validated. According to my online distributor, it is one of the most popular docs on Netflix, now in many languages/regions there.\r\n\r\n2) Itâ€™s all been debunked!\r\n\r\nThe term â€œdebunkedâ€ has become a mantra of sorts by the anti-ztm crowd. You also see this kind of overly zealous absolutism in other communities as well, such as the atheist community. As an atheist myself, I have learned that compassion is much more powerful than ridicule and if the goal of any communication is to change minds, taking a condescending and â€œabsoluteâ€ approach does nothing but inflate the initiators ego â€“ not help educate others.\r\n\r\nIn that, many interpreted the first section of Zeitgeist: The Movie as an attack on religion. I would say it is providing a contrary view of its history and it does so in a non-derisive way. It is very academic in its presentation and to call it an â€œattackâ€ is without merit.\r\n\r\nThat noted, â€œZeitgeist: The Movieâ€ was an art piece first and foremost and a great deal of liberty was taken in its expression. In the very first edition, I had a section with John F. Kennedy talking about the â€œgrand conspiracyâ€ of Communism and overlaid it onto his assassination footage. I knew what I was doing and did so because it was an amazing artistic effect. It wasnâ€™t until the film was grossly misinterpreted in its mixed genre style and artistic license that I later went back and made such editorial changes to conform it to a more â€œdocumentary formâ€.\r\n\r\nI was sad to have to do this, in factâ€¦ but It seems it was too advanced a piece for common culture","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c84c3a8637a921ef98790f5f905eb66c40a3cf9","amp;dn":"Zeitgeist%3A+The+Movie+%28NTSC+DVD5+ISO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c84c3a8637a921ef98790f5f905eb66c40a3cf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,132,195,168,99,122,146,30,249,135,144,245,249,5,235,102,196,10,60,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
