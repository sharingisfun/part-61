Bradburn, Tom Bittinger (Nova, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nIn this book, the authors present current research in the study of the structural biochemistry, formation and function, and usage of micelles. Topics discussed in this compilation include acid-base equilibrium in aqueous micellar solutions of surfactants; computational methods as tools for the study of RM structure and dynamics; thermodynamic aspects of micelles; micellisation of gemini surfactants in aqueous solutions; micelles from lipoamino acids; construction of block copolymer micelles and single-chain nanoparticles in non-selective solvents; block polyelectrolyte micelles/protein mixed nanostructures in aqueous media; and a treatment strategy for the gastrointestinal development of extremely premature infants by administration of micelles derived from pulmonary surfactants and the vernix caseosa in pregnant rabbits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8050001ab6be4cd3a18bdd43349da2ffc76e10cf","amp;dn":"Micelles+-+Structural+Biochemistry%2C+Formation+and+Functions+and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8050001ab6be4cd3a18bdd43349da2ffc76e10cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,80,0,26,182,190,76,211,161,139,221,67,52,157,162,255,199,110,16,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
