Psychologists use Systematic Desensitization and Habituation to get people off Vicodin and Xanax. Imagine how well they work on chips and cookies. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Control Your Cravings With Delayed Gratification Techniques That Teach Discipline Without Suffering. Based on famed psychologist Walter Mischelâ€™s â€œMarshmallowâ€ experiments, they will painlessly help you master self-control and help you reach your diet and weight loss goals. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Eat Healthier Without Forcing Yourself To Eat What You Donâ€™t Like. Use the â€œNutriliciousâ€ concept to make healthier choices without sacrificing taste or preferences. \r\n\r\nThis weight loss book is about how I lost 14 pounds and 2 waist sizes and kept it off for 25 years without ever going on a diet. Inspired by Walter Mischelâ€™s iconic The Marshmallow Test, Iâ€™ll show you a science-based weight loss plan that uses not a diet guide but a psychological approach to painlessly reducing the amount of food you eat. It chronicles how I did it and lays out a plan for how you can too","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bda177dcd716fe21c8ee7092237078762ec20be","amp;dn":"Eat+It+Later%3A+Mastering+Self+Control","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bda177dcd716fe21c8ee7092237078762ec20be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,218,23,125,205,113,111,226,28,142,231,9,34,55,7,135,98,236,32,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
