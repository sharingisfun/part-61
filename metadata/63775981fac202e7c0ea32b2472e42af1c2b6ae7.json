(zero footprint system)\r\n\r\nPI only allows three incoming user selectable ports, vpn(requires users RSA key), sshd(requires users RSA key) and https(requires user login password to download connection packages).\r\n\r\nDesigned to internconnect with other PI's to form a dynamic VPN network, SSH-VNC-GNOME users on one PI can privately email, chat and securely share files with SSH-VNC-GNOME users connected to other PI's and auto-connects and disconnects shared vpn drives with on-screen notifications.\r\n\r\nThe VPN host PI can act as the default Internet gateway for remote computers connected to VPN Guests PI's.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany safety features are built-in PI, for example RSA GNOME Desktop packages are deleted within 60 seconds after download from the internal https server and a download notification is sent to PI sys admins, this prevent piggyback downloads. PI firewall is dynamic and automatically adjust to selected https, vpn and ssh ports/protocols. PI can send IP change notifications to a group shared email address so RSA GNOME clients can follow their server.\r\n\r\n\r\nPI menu system,\r\n\r\n\r\n=======================\r\nemail:  \r\nVPN email:  \r\nPublic IP:\r\nPrivate IP:192.168.2.96\r\n========================\r\n\r\nRSA User Accounts\r\n1-Add\r\n2-Delete\r\n3-Disable\r\n4-Enable\r\nR-Replace RSA Package \r\n\r\nVPN Client Certificates\r\n5-Add\r\n6-Delete\r\n\r\nVPN Service \r\n7-Start VPN Server\r\n8-Connect to VPN Server\r\n\r\nRouter \r\n9-Start Router\r\n\r\nC-Control Panel\r\n\r\nX-exit\r\n\r\nPlease select option,then press enter\r\n\r\n==========================================\r\n\r\nC-Control Panel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n========================================\r\n\r\nControl Panel\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nVPN Server udp 28452 : SSH Server tcp 120 : HTTPS Server tcp 180\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n** 1) VPN Protocol &amp; Port \r\n** 2) SSH Port \r\n** 3) HTTPS Port \r\n** 4) Mailto route \r\n** 5) Replace SSH Server Certificate \r\n** 6) Replace VPN Server Certificate \r\n** 7) Firewall\r\n** 8) Memory Disk Usage\r\n** M) Main Menu \r\n*********************************************\r\nPlease select option, enter to exit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63775981fac202e7c0ea32b2472e42af1c2b6ae7","amp;dn":"Private+Internet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63775981fac202e7c0ea32b2472e42af1c2b6ae7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,119,89,129,250,194,2,231,192,234,50,178,71,46,66,175,28,43,106,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
