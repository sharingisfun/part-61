Numerous studies have shown that it helps in reducing symptoms of some of the most fatal illnesses, which is why cannabis oil has been legalized for medical purposes in numerous countries across the globe.\r\n\r\nWhile a public debate on legalization is going on in many more countries, in Serbia any possession of marijuana is illegal. Arrests of people with illnesses, as well as their family members, have been made. And yet, more and more people are buying the oil illegally.\r\n\r\nVice Serbia speaks with some of these families who wished to hide their identities, fearing the Serbian authorities.
