Never EVER send anything there.\r\nfelt really bad for all the people that got ripped off.\r\ni.e. Our go to solution was always an OS recovery where you paid $150 to have us reinstall your OS. MOST of the time we also charged to have us back up your files ($80) and then transfer it back. OOH also then made you &quot;find&quot; the os disks (really they are partitioned on your HD) and if not....buy a new one from our conveniently placed shelf of software right next to us ;)\r\nAfter seeing this money ripoff machine, I decided to share the software that we use.\r\n\r\nShare this everywhere, I'll keep updating it whenever an update becomes available. Support my work and keep seeding so that we can get it spread everywhere. \r\n\r\nBy -- M.Justice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e70493a014070409959fca1083a1172ddafcd7e9","amp;dn":"GEEK+SQUAD+MRI+5.10.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e70493a014070409959fca1083a1172ddafcd7e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,4,147,160,20,7,4,9,149,159,202,16,131,161,23,45,218,252,215,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
