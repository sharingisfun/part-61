This is a collection of mostly demos someone had put together under the name &quot;Afterglow....plus (Disc 1)&quot;.  (Never found a Disc 2.)  The torrent was originally in the SHN format.  I used Trader's Little Helper to convert them to wav files, then used freac to convert them to MP3.  I've included both formats - for the purists and for the casual listener.  \r\n\r\nProdigal Son (Demo)\r\nCatherine Wheels (Demo)\r\nWeather With You (Demo)\r\nThere Goes God (Demo)\r\nHow Will You Go (Demo)\r\nIt's Only Natural (Demo)\r\nChocolate Cake (Demo)\r\nFour Seasons In One Day (Demo)\r\nStrangeness and Charm (Demo)\r\nIn Love With It All (Demo)\r\nZen Roxy (Instrumental)\r\nWeather With You (Remix)\r\nPrivate Universe (Version 3)\r\nDistant Sun (Version 2)\r\nI Am In Love\r\nRecurring Dream (Original Version)\r\nShe's Not There\r\nRecurring Dream (New Version)\r\nSuffer Never (Remix)\r\nMarina (Finn)\r\n\r\n***********************\r\n\r\nGrab and go is never cool.  Please help keep these torrents alive.  Whenever you grab a torrent, you should continue to seed for others, at least until your ratio reaches 1.0 or higher.  I'm still kind of new to this, but I believe that if you make any changes to the files you've downloaded or if you move them from their original download location, it will stop seeding.  I usually COPY my music files from my download folder to an empty folder on my desktop, rename them how I like, then add them to my music library.  This leaves the torrent in its original condition and location so it will seed for others.\r\n\r\nWe've all been frustrated by dead and incomplete torrents.  This wouldn't happen if everyone seeded until their ratio got well over 1 for every individual torrent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d69f89e57b108fdaa2f2f57ff13ee98bdaf7059","amp;dn":"Crowded+House+-+Afterglow+Plus+-+demos+and+remixes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d69f89e57b108fdaa2f2f57ff13ee98bdaf7059","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,105,248,158,87,177,8,253,170,47,47,87,255,19,238,152,189,175,112,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
