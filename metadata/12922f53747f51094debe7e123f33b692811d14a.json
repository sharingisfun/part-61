Wolf (Wiley-VCH, 2006).pdf\r\n\r\nWith the second edition of his highly successful textbook 'Nanophysics and Nanotechnology', the author has once more provided a unique, self-contained introduction to the physical concepts, techniques and applications of nanoscale systems by covering its entire spectrum from the latest examples right up to single-electron and molecular electronics. The book is basically at the level of an upper level undergraduate engineering or science student. New sections have been added on the use of DNA as an organizing stratagem in self-assembly, silicon nanowires, comments on the new success toward human cloning, the achievement of self-replication in a primitive set of electromechanical robots, recognition in the extra chapters of the acceleration toward alternative forms of nanoelectronics. Additional problems have also been provided.\r\n\r\n* Free solutions manual available for lecturers at www.wiley-vch.de/supplements/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12922f53747f51094debe7e123f33b692811d14a","amp;dn":"Nanophysics+and+Nanotechnology+2nd+ed+-+Edward+L.+Wolf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12922f53747f51094debe7e123f33b692811d14a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,146,47,83,116,127,81,9,77,235,231,225,35,243,59,105,40,17,209,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
