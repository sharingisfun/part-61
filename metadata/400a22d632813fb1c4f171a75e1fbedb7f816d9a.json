The alliance maintains its international supremacy through its elite security force whose cybernetically enhanced operatives tackle an array of hi-tech terrorists and other threats to international security. These augmented agents can &quot;ghost hack&quot; (i.e., download their consciousness) via the now omnipresent internet into other machines and human/machine cross breeds. Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cybernetically augmented female agent, has been tracking a virtual entity known as the Puppet Master with her crack squad of security agents. The shape-shifting Puppet Master, a rogue creation of a rival agency of the security apparatus, has concluded that it is a life form in its own right, &quot;born in sea of information,&quot; and requested political asylum and true physical existence in defiance of its creators.\r\n\r\nContains 1 movie\r\n\r\nSpoken Languages: English, Japanese\r\n\r\nSubtitles : English subtitles.\r\n\r\nRipped directly from the disk.\r\nVideo\r\nCodec: MPEG-4 AVC (29.32 Mbps)\r\nResolution: 1080p\r\nAspect ratio: 1.85:1\r\nOriginal aspect ratio: 1.85:1\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nEnglish: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (48kHz, 24-bit)\r\nJapanese: LPCM 2.0 (48kHz, 24-bit)\r\n\r\nSubtitles\r\nEnglish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:400a22d632813fb1c4f171a75e1fbedb7f816d9a","amp;dn":"%5BNekoBDMV%5D%5BGhost+in+the+Shell+1995%5D%5BBlu-ray+Box%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"400a22d632813fb1c4f171a75e1fbedb7f816d9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,10,34,214,50,129,63,177,196,241,113,167,94,31,190,219,127,129,109,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
