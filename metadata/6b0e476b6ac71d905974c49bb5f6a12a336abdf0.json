The result is invaluable reading for inorganic and physical chemists, colloid chemists, polymer chemists, materials scientists, physicists, and chemical engineers working with and/or developing nanoparticle systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b0e476b6ac71d905974c49bb5f6a12a336abdf0","amp;dn":"Nanocrystals+Forming+Mesoscopic+Structures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b0e476b6ac71d905974c49bb5f6a12a336abdf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,14,71,107,106,199,29,144,89,116,196,155,181,246,161,42,51,106,189,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
