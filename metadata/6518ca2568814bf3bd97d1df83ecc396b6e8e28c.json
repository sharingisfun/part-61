He also wrote a great deal of chamber and sacred music. Rubbra's works went into eclipse in the 60s and 70s, as the BBC management pushed British serialists to garner musical attention abroad, but he lived long enough to see the critical tide reverse itself, and respect return for at least some of his life's work.\r\n\r\nHis Second Symphony was a relatively early work, but both its typically searching character and modal treatment suggest the mature composer. Much lay ahead of him, but he was already a seasoned composer by the time he wrote this.\r\n\r\nTwo bios enclosed.\r\n\r\nYou can find my classical uploads by searching on Philidor, or checking this thread:\r\n \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Philidor-s-uploads--63895","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6518ca2568814bf3bd97d1df83ecc396b6e8e28c","amp;dn":"Rubbra+-+Sym+%232+-+R+Hickox%2C+BBC+Nat+O+of+Wales+%281996%29+%5BPhilidor%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6518ca2568814bf3bd97d1df83ecc396b6e8e28c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,24,202,37,104,129,75,243,189,151,209,223,131,236,195,150,182,232,226,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
