Inspire Magazine Boasts. @thomasjoscelyn. @billroggio. @followfdd\r\nâ€œâ€¦The Taliban claimed to have taken over large areas of Pul-i-Khumri and the neighboring district of Baghlan-i-Jadid (also known as Baghlan-i-Markazi). On May 14, the Taliban released a statement on Voice of Jihad claiming its fighters â€œ[dismantled] two more bases as well as [purged] two villages from the enemy after hours of fightingâ€ in Baghlan-i-Jadid and â€œtook over a major military base and a number of checkpointsâ€ in Pul-i-Khumri.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe next day, the Taliban released a detailed report claiming major gains in Pul-i-Khumri. According to the statement, the Taliban overran nine villages and four â€œposts,â€ while its fighters â€œlaid a siege around a fortified base and blocked off the main road extending to #Mazar-i-Sharif,â€ the capital of Balkh province. The Taliban claimed it repelled Afghan forces attempting to break the siege of the base.\r\n\r\nWhile it is difficult to independently confirm the Talibanâ€™s claims bout the fighting in Baghlan, press reports indicate that the jihadist organization has made gains in the north and are disrupting transportation on the Ring Road, or Highway 1, in Baghlan. The Ring Road connects #Afghanistanâ€™s largest cities and is the major highway in the country.\r\n\r\nâ€œLast week, The New York Times confirmed that the Taliban shut down the vital artery after ambushing policemen guarding it.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif was cut off, as were road connections to eight northern provinces,â€ the Times reported on May 14.\r\n \nhttp://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/05/syrian-rebels-deny-hezbollahs-military-commander-killed-in-artillery-shelling.php\r\n \nhttp://www.longwarjournal.org\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:718aa6ca49d30d7ea865c0f06a506ea92d1c4b11","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Taliban+Commands+Battlefield.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"718aa6ca49d30d7ea865c0f06a506ea92d1c4b11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,138,166,202,73,211,13,126,168,101,192,240,106,80,110,169,45,28,75,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
