Extensive indexing and cross-referencing allows the series to grow, volume by volume, into an important reference work that deserves to be an integral part of any scientific library. Specifically, volume 78 comprises: Â· 546 graphical abstracts covering the mainstream organic chemistry literature to November 2010 Â· A summary of reviews covering the six-month period to April 2011, collated into easily-accessible sections Â· An informed commentary on research trends during the six-month period to June 2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1b8f246d03c05c618a1b6cb45a81ee0dfc4d0e5","amp;dn":"Theilheimer%27s+Synthetic+Methods+of+Organic+Chemistry+Vol.+78","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1b8f246d03c05c618a1b6cb45a81ee0dfc4d0e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,184,242,70,208,60,5,198,24,161,182,203,69,168,30,224,223,196,208,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
