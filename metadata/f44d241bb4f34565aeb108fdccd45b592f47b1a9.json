The Texas Ranger and real-life cowboy is hot-on-hot sexy, from the tips of his boots to the top of his Stetson. Despite her visceral reaction to the man, the last thing Laine expects is a whirlwind romance--but that's exactly what she gets.\r\n\r\nWes has been around the block enough to know what he wants, and he wants Laine. He wastes no time showing her how he feels...but he may never get the chance to tell her. Laine has disappeared, and it will take every connection Wes has--and a little help from a mangy stray--to get her back in his arms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f44d241bb4f34565aeb108fdccd45b592f47b1a9","amp;dn":"Susan+Stoker-Justice+for+Laine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f44d241bb4f34565aeb108fdccd45b592f47b1a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,77,36,27,180,243,69,101,174,177,8,253,204,212,91,89,47,71,177,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
