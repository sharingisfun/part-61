According to the Daily Mail, the Department of Homeland Security just released new guidelines\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nScrambling Liberals Don't Know Who to Blame for the Istanbul Airport Attack\r\nJune 29, 2016\r\n\r\nRUSH: Since it is awkward to try to blame guns for this attack, given that Turkey practically has banned its citizens from owning firearms, the Drive-Bys and the rest of the Obama administration are scrambling to come up with somebody to blame here.  \r\nScrambling Liberals Don't Know Who to Blame for the Istanbul Airport Attack\r\n\r\nWaPo Responds to Me, Tells Us Why Apes Aren't Evolving Into Humans\r\n\r\nRUSH: Right here it is, the very question I asked, attempting to stimulate a fire and cause chaos out there. Now they're actually asking it! I guarantee you this comes from that program.  I guarantee you.  What this is, is a science column where they answer questions written in by readers.  The headline exactly:  &quot;Dear Science:  Why Aren't Apes Evolving into Humans?&quot; You know what the answer is, by the way? Quick answer: Dear so-and-so... &quot;We are apes.&quot;\r\n\r\nThere's a High Probability Nate Silver Is Wrong Again About Donald Trump\r\nRUSH:  He's back now predicting Hillary Clinton has a 79% chance of winning the presidency, compared to Trump's 20%.  Now, Silver still has a lot of acolytes out there.  He still has a lot of true believers.  And they're applauding and they're partying and they're ecstatic, but they are forgetting something crucial.  Nate Silver has been wrong about Donald Trump predictions seven times since last June.\r\n\r\nYou're Going to Be Hearing This Soon: Conservatives Make Gays Unhealthy\r\n\r\nRUSH: If all of this stress resulting from interpersonal and structural discrimination is leading to an unfair share of alcoholism, heavy cigarette use, and generally impaired physical and mental health, don't you think that investigators will find ways to scientifically, quote, unquote, blame all of this on the hate-filled, racist, sexist, bigoted, and homophobic Republican Party? \r\n\r\nwhat? only 2 % gays not  99 percent Homophobia !!!\r\n \nhttp://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2016/06/29","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7b0eafe95077c09fd8fd02ef1c2e50d008a2f85","amp;dn":"Rush+Limbaugh+-+June+29%2C+2016+Full+Podcast.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7b0eafe95077c09fd8fd02ef1c2e50d008a2f85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,176,234,254,149,7,124,9,253,143,208,46,241,194,229,13,0,138,47,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
