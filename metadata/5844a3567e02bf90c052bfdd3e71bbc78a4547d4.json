Wilkins et al. (Springer, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nProteomics is a multifaceted, interdisciplinary field which studies the complexity and dynamics of proteins in biological systems. It combines powerful separation and analytical technology with advanced informatics to understand the function of proteins in the cell and in the body. This book provides a clear conceptual description of each facet of proteomics, describes recent advances in technology and thinking in each area, and provides details of how these have been applied to a variety of biological problems. It is written by expert practitioners in the field, from industry, research institutions, and the clinic. It provides junior and experienced researchers with an invaluable proteomic reference, and gives fascinating glimpses of the future of this dynamic field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5844a3567e02bf90c052bfdd3e71bbc78a4547d4","amp;dn":"Proteome+Research+-+Concepts%2C+Technology+and+Application+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5844a3567e02bf90c052bfdd3e71bbc78a4547d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,68,163,86,126,2,191,144,192,82,191,221,62,113,187,199,138,69,71,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
