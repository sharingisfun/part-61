From the opening notes, it is clear that we are in for a fascinating recital. The group has a direct, open sound reminiscent of Musica Reservata. The music is presented without any soft edges. Not everyone will like this, but even fifteen years after the CDâ€™s first release it makes a refreshing change...\r\n\r\n&quot;Pageâ€™s argument is that much of the 15th century repertoire is presented in highly speculative versions and that it is about time we heard the music with voices alone. This works very well and you never feel that there is something missing. It also means that the secular pieces lack that rather generic up-tempo instrumental and percussion beat which can become too common in this repertoire; catchy certainly, but inhibiting also. Here the music is presented on its own, and the voices never feel unsupported. Pageâ€™s singers confidently present us with a stimulating new perspective on old material.\r\n \r\n&quot;Singing the secular items unaccompanied enables Page to create a recital based on both secular and sacred items without any awkward joins. Instead we get a fascinatingly seamless narrative where prayers to the Virgin Mary run cheek by jowl with love songs.&quot; \r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nYou can find all my classical uploads by searching on Philidor, or in this thread:\r\n  \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Philidor-s-uploads--63895","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e683f0001ba79deda920e1f117cae807106043b6","amp;dn":"Spanish+Songs+Motets+1480-1550+-+Gothic+Voices+%281993%29+%5BPhilidor%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e683f0001ba79deda920e1f117cae807106043b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,131,240,0,27,167,157,237,169,32,225,241,23,202,232,7,16,96,67,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
