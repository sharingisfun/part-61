After working her way up as an intern, she burst on the scene as a young female jock whose on-air â€œBattle of the Beatsâ€ segment broke records and became a platform for emerging artists like a young Jay Z. Angie quickly became known for intimate, high-profile interviews, mediating feuds between artists, and taking on the most controversial issues in hip hop. At age twenty-five, at the height of the East Coast/West Coast rap war, Angie was summoned by Tupac Shakur for what would be his last no-holds-barred interviewâ€”which has never aired in its entirety and which sheâ€™s never discussed in detailâ€”until now.  \r\n \r\nAngie shares stories from behind-the-scenes of her most controversial conversations, from onetime presidential hopeful Barack Obama to superstars like Mary J. Blige and Chris Brown, and describes her emotional, bittersweet final days at Hot 97 and the highly publicized move to Power 105.1. She also opens up about her personal lifeâ€”from her roots in Washington Heights and her formative years being raised by a single mom in Brooklyn to exploring the lessons that shaped her into the woman she is today","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ef6659ad9789809652526dd5951db71f8e037e1","amp;dn":"Angie+Martinez+-+My+Voice+A+Memoir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ef6659ad9789809652526dd5951db71f8e037e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,246,101,154,217,120,152,9,101,37,38,221,89,81,219,113,248,224,55,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
