Over three years, she scrapped a full Ladyhawke album (â€œThe material didnâ€™t feel like me. It felt too dark or somethingâ€). Once reliant on alcohol to surmount social anxiety (â€œIâ€™d never done a sober show in my life until last Decemberâ€), she quit drinking and focused on getting healthy. Then she welcomed that newfound clarity by crafting her latest release, the blissed-out Wild Things.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01. A Love Song 3:24\r\n02. The River 3:26\r\n03. Wild Things 5:13\r\n04.
