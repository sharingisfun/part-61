This second volume in the series Advances in Microbial Food Safety summarises major recent advances in this field, and complements volume 1 to provide an essential overview of developments in food microbiology. Part one opens the book with an interview with a food safety expert. Part two provides updates on single pathogens, and part three looks at pathogen detection, identification and surveillance. Part four covers pathogen control and food preservation. Finally, part five focuses on pathogen control management","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5ae34d4f5510a7077966e32deb3b3ef4a8acd70","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Microbial+Food+Safety+Vol.+2+-+John+Sofos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5ae34d4f5510a7077966e32deb3b3ef4a8acd70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,174,52,212,245,81,10,112,119,150,110,50,222,179,179,239,74,138,205,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
