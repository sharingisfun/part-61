He hides his sword and is arrested by the police while leaving the stadium. Russell recalls his life in the Sixteenth Century in Scotland, when he is Connor MacLeod and is deadly wounded in a battle against another Clan. However he surprisingly survives and his Clan believes he has a pact with the devil and expels him from their lands. Then he meets Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez that explains that he is immortal unless he is beheaded. Further, the immortals dispute a game killing each other and in the end only one survives receiving a price with the power of the other immortals. Russell is released by the police, but the snoopy forensic agent Brenda J. Wyatt is attracted by the case since she founds fragments of an ancient Katana and follows Russell. But the also immortal Kurgan is hunting down MacLeod and Brenda is in the middle of their battle.                \r\n\r\nYear: 1986                \r\nDirector: Russell Mulcahy                \r\nWriters: Gregory Widen, Peter Bellwood, Larry Ferguson                \r\nStars: Christopher Lambert, Roxanne Hart, Clancy Brown, Sean Connery, Beatie Edney, Alan North, Jon Polito, Sheila Gish, Hugh Quarshie, Christopher Malcolm                \r\nGenres: Action, Adventure, Fantasy                \r\nLanguage: English                \r\n\r\nRELEASE.....................: Highlander.1986.720p.BluRay.x264.VPPV\r\nVIDEO.......................: 1000  \r\nCODEC.......................: x264\r\nRUNTIME.....................: 116 min\t         \r\nRESOLUTION..................: 1280x690                \r\nFRAME RATE..................: 24.000 fps\r\nAUDIO.......................: 2 Channel / AAC / 192kbps                \r\nFILE SIZE / FORMAT..........: 996 MiB / MKV\r\nSOURCE......................: BluRay                \r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nPoster:  \nhttps://snap.vppv.la/highlander/1986/highlander-1986-poster.jpg \r\n\r\nWarning!!!
