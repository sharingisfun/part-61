J. Doona et al. (WP, 2010).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-84569-551-4\r\n\r\nNovel food processing technologies have significant potential to improve product quality and process efficiency. Commercialisation of new products and processes brings exciting opportunities and interesting challenges. Case studies in novel food processing technologies provides insightful, first-hand experiences of many pioneering experts involved in the development and commercialisation of foods produced by novel processing technologies.\r\n\r\nPart one presents case studies of commercial products preserved with the leading nonthermal technologies of high pressure processing and pulsed electric field processing. Part two broadens the case histories to include alternative novel techniques, such as dense phase carbon dioxide, ozone, ultrasonics, cool plasma, and infrared technologies, which are applied in food preservation sectors ranging from fresh produce, to juices, to disinfestation. Part three covers novel food preservation techniques using natural antimicrobials, novel food packaging technologies, and oxygen depleted storage techniques. Part four contains case studies of innovations in retort technology, microwave heating, and predictive modelling that compare thermal versus non-thermal processes, and evaluate an accelerated 3-year challenge test.\r\n\r\nWith its team of distinguished editors and international contributors, Case studies in novel food processing technologies is an essential reference for professionals in industry, academia, and government involved in all aspects of research, development and commercialisation of novel food processing technologies.\r\n\r\nProvides insightful, first-hand experiences of many pioneering experts involved in the development and commercialisation of foods produced by novel processing technologies\r\nPresents case studies of commercial products preserved with the leading nonthermal technologies of high pressure processing and pulsed electric field processing\r\nFeatures alternative novel techniques, such as dense phase carbon dioxide, ozone, ultrasonics, cool plasma, and infrared technologies utilised in food preservation sectors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57aac2e596e7962a026f30ccf790bc62c8d7d7a3","amp;dn":"Case+Studies+in+Novel+Food+Processing+Technologies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57aac2e596e7962a026f30ccf790bc62c8d7d7a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,170,194,229,150,231,150,42,2,111,48,204,247,144,188,98,200,215,215,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
