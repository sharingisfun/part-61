From the seemingly unnecessary actions of extreme sportspeople to the excessive risk appetites of serial entrepreneurs, the term â€˜riskyâ€™ is often seen as synonymous with â€˜recklessâ€™, â€˜foolhardyâ€™ or even downright dangerous.\r\n\r\nBut could any of us live in a world without risk, and would it be desirable to do so?\r\n\r\nThrough a series of nine wonderfully rich pen portraits, Polly Morland takes us on a journey through the world of risk, looking not at the extremes or exceptions, but at the routine risks we accept and embrace as part of our everyday lives, often unconsciously.\r\n\r\nMeet the families who have lived happily on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius for generations; the Paris Opera ballet dancer facing up to the physical, psychological and reputational risks her profession demands; the New York City forensic engineer for whom being first on the scene is just part of the day job. And marvel at the parents and playworkers who every day balance the risks and rewards of how much autonomy and independence to afford growing children.\r\n\r\nThe stories in Risk Wise address fundamental questions about risk and our perceptions about risk-taking. It argues that being risk wise â€“ the ability to understand and accept risk as a force for good â€“ is an essential part of the human experience and a route to living a full and rewarding life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n                          Visit us for more Awesome ebooks             \r\n\r\n                               http://booksdeity.com/\r\n \r\n                         **********************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04d32b9bddf56641d25a1d29a9258b52a92706cd","amp;dn":"Risk+Wise+Nine+Everyday+Adventures+by+Polly+Morland.epub+%7BBD%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04d32b9bddf56641d25a1d29a9258b52a92706cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,211,43,155,221,245,102,65,210,90,29,41,169,37,139,82,169,39,6,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
