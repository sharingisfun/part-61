Rotkin, S. Subramoney (Springer, 2005).pdf\r\n\r\nThe book describes the state-of-the-art in fundamental, applied and device physics of nanotubes, including fabrication, manipulation and characterization for device applications; optics of nanotubes; transport and electromechanical devices and fundamentals of theory for applications. This information is critical to the field of nanoscience since nanotubes have the potential to become a very significant electronic material for decades to come. The book will benefit all all readers interested in the application of nanotubes, either in their theoretical foundations or in newly developed characterization tools that may enable practical device fabrication","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38fd06c12a0402c9ada2c9c079646c74849b7319","amp;dn":"Applied+Physics+of+Carbon+Nanotubes+-+S.V.+Rotkin%2C+S.+Subramoney","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38fd06c12a0402c9ada2c9c079646c74849b7319","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,253,6,193,42,4,2,201,173,162,201,192,121,100,108,116,132,155,115,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
