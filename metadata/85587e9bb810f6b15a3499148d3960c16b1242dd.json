The aspects of seafood quality covered range from the impact of slaughter procedures, through protein functionality, texture, flavour, histamine toxicity to the practical evaluation of quality and measurement. Technological aspects concentrate on automation in processing, waste-water treatment and reuse of scraps. Marine nutraceuticals/functional foods are discussed in detail. This book is highly recommended for scientists and technologists in the seafood industries, plus fish processing professionals, quality managers, and nutritonists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85587e9bb810f6b15a3499148d3960c16b1242dd","amp;dn":"Seafoods+-+Quality%2C+Technology+and+Nutraceutical+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85587e9bb810f6b15a3499148d3960c16b1242dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,88,126,155,184,16,246,177,90,52,153,20,141,57,96,193,107,18,66,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
