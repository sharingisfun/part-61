Original Broadway Cast Recording features the incomparable Sahr Ngaujah as Fela singing with the irrepressibly funky Anitbalas. All 16 of the Fela compositions that are performed on stage each night are on the record as are several songs performed by Funmalayo as played by Lilias White, and Sandra Izadore as played by Saycon Sengbloh. The record was produced by Robert Sher who has been nominated for many Broadway Cast Recording Grammys.\r\n\r\nBased on the life of groundbreaking African composer and performer Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, FELA! is the critically acclaimed Broadway musical that uses Fela's music to explore his life as an artist, political activist and revolutionary musician.\r\n\r\nDirected and choreographed by Tony Award winner Bill T. Jones with arrangements by Aaron Johnson and Antibalas, FELA! is a provocative hybrid of concert, dance and musical theatre. The cast recording captures the electricity and joy that thousands have experienced at the Eugene O'Neill Theater every night since the play opened on November 23, 2009. The record is a document of that experience, yet at the same time is a musical statement in its own right.\r\n\r\nReview\r\n'...there has never been anything on Broadway like this production...' --Ben Brantley, The New York Times\r\n\r\n'...this decade's most exhilarating new Broadway musical.' --Elysa Gardner, USA Today\r\n\r\n\r\nDisc: 1\r\n1.
