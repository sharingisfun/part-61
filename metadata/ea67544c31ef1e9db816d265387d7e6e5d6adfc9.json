It's a peak work of his from his most popular decade, the 1950s, written between his very successful Fourth and Fifth Symphonies. It shares a love of great orchestral color, intensity, and quirkiness--the second movement, for instance, is for solo violin. The soloist is Lorraine McAslan.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
