In 2008 it was gauche to bring up the vicious racist Rev. Jeremiah Wright, whose trite cast-off slogan â€œaudacity of hopeâ€ inspired the title of Barack Obamaâ€™s campaign primer. In 2012, it would have apparently been rude for Mitt Romney to have fired back at Candy Crowley, â€œHow dare you hijack a presidential debate!â€ Yes, Trump may be creepy, but the reluctance to challenge our present naked emperors is just as creepy. Is the so-called establishment going to warn us that Trump would be capable of running up $10 trillion in debt, socializing our medical system, unleashing the IRS and EPA on perceived enemies, and weakening friends and empowering enemies abroad, as he offers the world historically challenged pop riffs on Islam, Hiroshima, and global geography? For each take-down of NeverTrump, can we at least have commensurate analysis of how and why a monstrosity like the Clinton cash operation was allowed to thrive without audit; or how it is that the secretary of state and her minions snubbed the law and behaved in a fashion that would have put any other federal employees in jail; or how it is that 155 years after the start of the Civil War over 300 cities, counties, and states have declared federal law null and void in their jurisdictions â€” and with complete impunity?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œCalifornia lawmakers seem intent on making Sacramento the place where reasonable reforms, much like runaway trains, jump the tracks. In that no-speed-limit spirit Tuesday, the California Assembly voted 41-37 to allow convicted felons to vote in jail. (Yes, you read that correctly â€” in jail.) If Assembly Bill 2466 becomes law, the ACLU estimates that 50,000 adults will be able to vote behind bars. The state doesnâ€™t trust these people on the streets, but they are welcome in the voting booth.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhen individuals commit crimes that endanger public safety, they forfeit their civil rights upon conviction. The National Conference of State Legislatures notes that the concept of â€œcivil deathâ€ goes back to the Greeks and Romans. In some states â€” Florida, Iowa â€” convicted felons are permanently disenfranchised. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe recently made news by suspending permanent disenfranchisement by temporary order. No need for that in California. In 1976, voters amended the Constitution to end the permanent disenfranchisement of felons. The California Constitution now reads: The Legislature â€œshall provide for the disqualification of electors while mentally incompetent or imprisoned or on parole for the conviction \r\nof a felonyâ€¦.â€\r\n\r\nCalifornia. Individuals convicted of a felony are ineligible to vote while incarcerated and on parole. Voting rights are automatically restored upon completion of parole, and people on probation can vote. Ex-offenders should re-register to vote.\r\n \nhttp://www.sfgate.com/opinion/saunders/article/Democrats-latest-power-grab-let-felons-vote-7957963.php?cmpid=fb-desktop\r\n \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/santoss-power-grab-in-the-name-of-peace-1463950910\r\n \nhttp://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/08/california-voting-rights-felons\r\n\r\nVictor Davis Hanson\r\nHistorian\r\nvictorhanson.com\r\nVictor Davis Hanson is an American military historian, columnist, former classics professor, and scholar of ancient warfare.
