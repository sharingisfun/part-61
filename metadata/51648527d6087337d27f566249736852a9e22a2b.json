In â€œWild Beyond Beliefâ€ we have a debut from a band that is destined to be a cult, or a gang at least. The actual sound of the album is quite strange at first, an ultra low, bass heavy mix completely devoid of treble, and clearly meant to blow your system. The muffled tone and constant tape hiss does give it even more of a vintage appeal however, but I feel like most will be thrown off by the mix at first. \r\n\r\nThe bass is also the dominant instrument, carving out thick punky grooves with a tone that mixes Dickie Peterson with Cronos, for a destructive effect. The guitars are a little lower in the mix, but are a total wash of fuzz and wah, not really chuggy but like a punk tone with sixties classic rock influence, and the leads played are in intermingling of those styles.\r\n\r\nThe vocals are pure howling, drenched reverb and soaked in booze and drugs; imagine the aforementioned Cronos trying to track vocals for Fun House by the Stooges! His voice isnâ€™t really impressive but he sings and shouts with pure lust for what hes doing, with plenty of rock star â€œOh Yeahsâ€™ and â€œAlrights. \r\n\r\nIf you are not well versed in fuzzy acid rock, and if you havenâ€™t seen the Wild Angels, the Devilâ€™s Angels, or Angels From Hell, you may not know what you are getting into. Better yet, if you donâ€™t know Blue Cheer, the Stooges, or Davie Allan and the Arrows, your gonna get blindsided. \r\n\r\nSatan's Satyrs - Wild Beyond Belief! 2012 320ak\r\n\r\nTitle: Wild Beyond Belief!\r\n\r\nCountry:  USA, Virginia\r\n\r\nYear:  2012\r\n\r\nBitrate:\t320ak\r\n\r\nSize:\t91.85 MB\r\n \t\r\n8 files\r\n\r\n\r\nGenre: Doom Metal / Hard Rock / Punk\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n1.
