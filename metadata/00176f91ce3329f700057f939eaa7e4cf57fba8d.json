Her new album, Love Remains, is available now.\r\n\r\nHow Hillary Lied to Parents of Benghazi Dead\r\nYes, Trump stepped in it by attacking the Khans, but where is the media outrage over Hillaryâ€™s lies to the Benghazi parents? Donald J. Trump really knows how to stick his foot in his mouth. And then his calf. And then his thigh. If he keeps going, he will be in real trouble. The Republican presidential nomineeâ€™s protracted fight with Ghazala and Khizr Khan has been a wholly unnecessary and incredibly unhelpful distraction from the fight he needs to wage against Hillary Clinton and her collectivist dream: to preserve Obamaism and protect the policies that have enfeebled America overseas and slowed GDP growth to a near-standstill â€” 1 percent, on average, for the first half of 2016. Trumpâ€™s battle with the mother and father of the late U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan â€” who was killed in action in Iraq in June 2004 â€” is cold, foolish, and self-destructive. When the Pakistani-born parents of this American military hero condemned Trumpâ€™s proposed limits on Muslim immigration, he should have let their words roll away, like raindrops on an umbrella. Instead, Trump grabbed that umbrella and smacked the Khans with it â€” even as Republicans recoiled, and Democrats danced jigs of joy.\r\n\r\nLie of the Day\r\nRepublican officials are so angry at [Trump] . . . that they're considering replacing him at the top of the ticket...\r\n-Travis Gettys, Raw Story, August 3, 2016\r\n\r\nObama Spends 7 Minutes Dodging On Whether Iran Will Use $400 Million To Fund Terrorism\r\n\r\n\r\n94,333,000 Americans were not in the labor force in July, a slightly better showing than Juneâ€™s 94,517,000; and the labor force participation rate improved slightly, increasing a tenth of a point to 62.8 percent from Juneâ€™s 62.7 percent, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reorted on Friday.\r\nIn September 2015, the labor force participation rate dropped to 62.4 percent, its lowest point since 1977.  The best itâ€™s been since Barack Obama took office is 65.8 percent in February 2009, the month after Obama was sworn in amid a recession.\r\n\r\nThe labor force participation rate is the percentage of people in the civilian noninstitutionalized population, age 16 or older, who are either working or actively seeking work.\r\n \nhttp://www.lauraingraham.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00176f91ce3329f700057f939eaa7e4cf57fba8d","amp;dn":"Laura+Ingraham+Aug+5+Dr+Sebestian+Gorka.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00176f91ce3329f700057f939eaa7e4cf57fba8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,23,111,145,206,51,41,247,0,5,127,147,158,170,126,76,245,127,186,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
