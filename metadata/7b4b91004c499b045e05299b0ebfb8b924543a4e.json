You have to survive managing 5 different sections of the ship with limited resources until you reach your destination: Hydra 228. \r\n\r\n9 years ago, the spaceship Demeter, started its journey to the planet 228 Hydra. At the end of its journey, while orbiting the planet, an anomaly occurred. \r\nAll communication is lost since then. But before cut-off from Earth, strange encrypted messages received from the ship. \r\nAfter eighteen months of preparation, spacecraft Quaser is set on route to unravel the mystery surrounding the incident and save the crew. \r\nBut about halfway over, things started to go wrong. With ship wide system failures and ever decreasing resources, chances of successfully completing the mission seems more distant than ever... \r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s new: \r\nRelease Version \r\n\r\nRequirements: Android OS 2.3 and up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b4b91004c499b045e05299b0ebfb8b924543a4e","amp;dn":"+Quaser+v1.1.3+full+%5Bapkpita%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b4b91004c499b045e05299b0ebfb8b924543a4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,75,145,0,76,73,155,4,94,5,41,155,14,191,184,185,36,84,58,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
