Computer vision technology in the food and beverage industries reviews image acquisition and processing technologies and their applications in particular sectors of the food industry.\r\n\r\nPart one provides an introduction to computer vision in the food and beverage industries, discussing computer vision and infrared techniques for image analysis, hyperspectral and multispectral imaging, tomographic techniques and image processing. Part two goes on to consider computer vision technologies for automatic sorting, foreign body detection and removal, automated cutting and image analysis of food microstructure. Current and future applications of computer vision in specific areas of the food and beverage industries are the focus of part three. Techniques for quality control of meats are discussed alongside computer vision in the poultry, fish and bakery industries, including techniques for grain quality evaluation, and the evaluation and control of fruit, vegetable and nut quality.\r\n\r\nWith its distinguished editor and international team of expert contributors, Computer vision technology in the food and beverage industries is an indispensible guide for all engineers and researchers involved in the development and use of state-of-the-art vision systems in the food industry.\r\n\r\nDiscusses computer vision and infrared techniques for image analysis, hyperspectral and multispectral imaging, tomographic techniques and image processing\r\nConsiders computer vision technologies for automatic sorting, foreign body detection and removal, automated cutting and image analysis of food microstructure\r\nExamines techniques for quality control and computer vision in various industries including the poultry, fish and bakery, fruit, vegetable and nut industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3db69e81744b0b3fc02910e6920a5518adcc170f","amp;dn":"Computer+Vision+Technology+in+the+Food+and+Beverage+Industries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3db69e81744b0b3fc02910e6920a5518adcc170f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,182,158,129,116,75,11,63,192,41,16,230,146,10,85,24,173,204,23,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
