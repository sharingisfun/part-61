He is best known today for his voluminous publication of organ works, several of them still in the regular repertoire, but his classical works for orchestra deserve attention, as well. They were too studied for the pops, too musically advanced for the conservative academics. A lonely figure, he drew strength from the depth of his personal relationships, at home and at work.\r\n\r\nThis, his fifth symphony, was dedicated to wife. It shows a considerable advance on technique from his fourth, as well as a broadening of his interest in then-modern French and Russian music.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
