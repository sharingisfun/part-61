Ramamurthy, K.S. Schanze (Marcel Dekker, 1998).djvu\r\n\r\nFocusing on complex naturally-occurring and synthetic supramolecular arrays, this work describes the mechanism by which transition metal complexes bind to DNA and how the DNA scaffold modifies the photochemical and photophysical properties to bound complexes. It includes details of photoinduced electron transfer between intercalated molecules, and examines thermally and photochemically induced electron transfer in supramolecular assemblies consisting of inorganic molecular building blocks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e58a5d85a66fca12484625f80af0171349bcaabd","amp;dn":"Organic+and+Inorganic+Photochemistry+-+V.+Ramamurthy%2C+K.S.+Schan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e58a5d85a66fca12484625f80af0171349bcaabd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,138,93,133,166,111,202,18,72,70,37,248,10,240,23,19,73,188,170,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
