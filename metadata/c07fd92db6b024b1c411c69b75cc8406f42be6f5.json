This material is provided with careful attention from the Andrew McKenzie of Hafler Trio and has been leaked from dishonest Soleilmoon label that was planed to release it. Because it might never happen, and we have no time to wait, you are invited to experience this material in full glory by your very self. Brion would like this distribution type, we think. Happy eating!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c07fd92db6b024b1c411c69b75cc8406f42be6f5","amp;dn":"Hafler+Trio+-+Brion+Gysins+Dreamachine+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c07fd92db6b024b1c411c69b75cc8406f42be6f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,127,217,45,182,176,36,177,196,17,198,155,117,204,132,6,244,43,230,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
