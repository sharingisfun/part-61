Wacky disco sampling and crazy synth edits make this a dubstep tune quite unlike any other, and is possibly the most anticipated part of the Division series. \r\n\r\nOn the flip, Brazilian electro superstars Dirtyloud have delivered a remix of outstanding class. Taking a more minimal approach to the modern complextro sound, the duo has managed to keep the vibe of the original while twisting it into a peak time 4x4 stomper.\r\n\r\n\r\n** PLEASE SEED TO KEEP THE TORRENT ALIVE! **\r\n\r\n-=====================-\r\n\r\nCover: https://geo-media.beatport.com/image/6229123.jpg\r\nBuy link: https://www.beatport.com/release/division-series-part-4/993139\r\n\r\n-=====================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae549c7f0695c42e1225f1014e0b2a64c561ea10","amp;dn":"SKisM+-+Division+Series+Part+4+%282012%29+%5BDubstep%2FElectro+House%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae549c7f0695c42e1225f1014e0b2a64c561ea10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,84,156,127,6,149,196,46,18,37,241,1,78,11,42,100,197,97,234,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
