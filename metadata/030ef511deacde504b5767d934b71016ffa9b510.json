It is in some ways a moody and acerbic piece, since Punch adores being admired by the Child, and loves having his mischief watched, but tires easily of anybody's presence--including hers. He finally ditches her, and she stands alone, bereft at its conclusion. This became a favorite of the fine conductor Thomas Beecham, who also recorded it in the early 1950s.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
