Now weâ€”and by â€œweâ€ I especially mean my fellow punditsâ€”are semioticians. We are no longer interested in what our political candidates say, but rather in what they mean to say. The plain reading of words has given way to the esoteric interpretation of gestures, signals, symbols and intent. When Mr. Trump says things that are, on their face, nonsensical, we do not say: â€œThis makes no sense.â€ We say, â€œLetâ€™s try to make sense of it.â€ We no longer lay the blame on the communicatorâ€™s failure to communicate, but on our supposed failure to understand. The Trump legions have sent America a â€œmessage,â€ and itâ€™s up to us to decode it by picking through the word jumble gushing out of Mr. Trumpâ€™s mouth.\r\n\r\nWonder Land Columnist Dan Henninger says the Republican frontrunner learned the wrong lessons from his business career in the Big Apple.\r\n \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/out-clintoning-the-clintons-1464642622?tesla=y \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-the-conservative-hope-1462833870\r\n \nhttp://topics.wsj.com/person/H/daniel-henninger/5468\r\n \nhttp://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Brett_Stevens \nhttp://topics.wsj.com/person/S/bret-stephens/5463\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t\r\n \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:973b8217640b93c4207b78859ddf6ced0169ebd9","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+MAD+Trump+Donald+J.+Clinton.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"973b8217640b93c4207b78859ddf6ced0169ebd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,59,130,23,100,11,147,196,32,123,120,133,157,223,108,237,1,105,235,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
