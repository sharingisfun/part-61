It discusses in detail the nucleation mechanism and the growth process of bimetallic systems, which is vital for a deeper understanding of the design of bimetallic catalysts. The author presents four pioneering studies: (1) syntheses of water-soluble octahedral, truncated octahedral, and cubic Ptâ€“Ni nanocrystals and the study of their structure-activity relationship in model hydrogenation reactions; (2) a strategy for designing a concave Ptâ€“Ni alloy using controllable chemical etching; (3) defect-dominated shape recovery of nanocrystals, which is a new synthesis strategy for trimetallic catalysts; (4) a sophisticated construction of Au islands on Ptâˆ’Ni, which is an ideal trimetallic nanoframe catalyst. This thesis inspires researchers working in materials, catalysis as well as other interdisciplinary areas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f473b668ea410e4c2bf9f2c23b6e0a0026760c49","amp;dn":"Controlled+Synthesis+of+Pt-Ni+Bimetallic+Catalysts+and+Study+of+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f473b668ea410e4c2bf9f2c23b6e0a0026760c49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,115,182,104,234,65,14,76,43,249,242,194,59,110,10,0,38,118,12,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
