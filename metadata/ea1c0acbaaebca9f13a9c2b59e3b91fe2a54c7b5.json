The applications include free and capped magnetic surfaces, magnetic atoms on metallic substrates, nanowires, nanocontacts, and domain walls. Some applications also deal with temperature-dependent effects and ab initio magnetization dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe author clarifies parallel and antiparallel, the distinction between classical spin vectors and spinors, and the actual form of spinâ€“orbit interactions, before showing how symmetry can provide the formal tools to properly define magnetic structures. After these introductory chapters, the book presents methods to describe anisotropic physical properties of magnetic nanostructures. It then focuses on magnetic anisotropy energies, exchange and Dzyaloshinskiiâ€“Moriya interactions, temperature-dependent effects, spin dynamics, and related properties of systems nanostructured in one and two dimensions. The book also discusses how methods of describing electric and magneto-optical properties are applied to magnetic nanostructured matter. It concludes with an outlook on emerging magnetic anisotrophic effects.\r\n\r\nWritten by a leading researcher with over 35 years of experience in the field, this book examines the theory and modeling of magnetic anisotropies in nanostructured materials. It shows how these materials are used in a range of applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea1c0acbaaebca9f13a9c2b59e3b91fe2a54c7b5","amp;dn":"Magnetic+Anisotropies+in+Nanostructured+Matter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea1c0acbaaebca9f13a9c2b59e3b91fe2a54c7b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,28,10,203,170,235,202,159,19,169,194,181,158,59,145,254,42,84,199,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
