Beard, Hong Qian (CUP, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nChemical Biophysics provides an engineering-based approach to biochemical system analysis for graduate-level courses on systems biology, computational bioengineering and molecular biophysics. It is the first textbook to apply rigorous physical chemistry principles to mathematical and computational modeling of biochemical systems for an interdisciplinary audience. The book is structured to show the student the basic biophysical concepts before applying this theory to computational modeling and analysis, building up to advanced topics and research. Topics explored include the kinetics of nonequilibrium open biological systems, enzyme mediated reactions, metabolic networks, biological transport processes, large-scale biochemical networks and stochastic processes in biochemical systems. End-of-chapter exercises range from confidence-building calculations to computational simulation projects","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de15a3c53ddb09732be64d8e5f0ebedc2aaa0858","amp;dn":"Chemical+Biophysics+-+Quantitative+Analysis+of+Cellular+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de15a3c53ddb09732be64d8e5f0ebedc2aaa0858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,21,163,197,61,219,9,115,43,230,77,142,95,14,190,220,42,170,8,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
