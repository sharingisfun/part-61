Leaning Tower of Musk. Bob Zimmerman, BehindtheBlack.com\r\nâ€œLed by American Jeff Williams, two astronauts opened the hatch and entered Bigelowâ€™s BEAM inflatable module on ISS today.\r\n\r\nWilliams officially opened the hatch at 08:47 UTC. Along with Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka, Williams entered BEAM for the first time to collect an air sample and begin downloading data from sensors on the dynamics of BEAMâ€™s expansion. The astronaut reported that the interior of BEAM looks â€œpristineâ€. However, he added the temperature was on the cool side â€“ with Houston adding they recorded 44F as the temperature at bulkhead â€“ but no condensation was visible. He then took air samples, as is the procedure for entering a new module.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey will install interior sensors over the next two days, and then shut the hatch. The module will then remain closed for most of its planned two year stay on ISS to test its operation in space.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe article also includes some nice details about the possible uses of Bigelowâ€™s much larger B330 modules, two of which are under construction right nowâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://behindtheblack.com/behind-the-black/points-of-information/astronaus-enter-privately-built-beam-module/\r\n \nhttps://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/06/williams-beam-expandable-module-milestone/\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:815deb2c7694de3658e2af4ed6a655f217bfbf3a","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Inflatabl+Station+Zimmerman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"815deb2c7694de3658e2af4ed6a655f217bfbf3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,93,235,44,118,148,222,54,88,226,175,78,214,166,85,242,23,191,191,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
