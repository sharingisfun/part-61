The book follows the Best Synthetic Methods format, containing practical methods, synthetic tips, and shortcuts. Where relevant, articles include toxicity data and historical context for the reactions. Typical analytical and spectroscopic data are also presented to enable scientists to identify key compound characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe book is a valuable companion to research chemists in both academia and industry, summarizing the best practical methods (often originating in difficult-to-access, foreign-language primary literature) in one place. It is ideally suited for those working on industrial applications of these compounds, including insecticides, herbicides, flame retardants, and plasticizers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes a mixture of tried and tested, historical methods that are proven to work, alongside new methods to provide scientists with a quick, time-saving resource of reliable methods\r\nIncludes tips and tricks to get reactions to work; important information often missing from other sources\r\nIncludes key analytical data for compounds, so scientists have one handy resource to select, perform, and analyze the best reaction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e52e1b4c62738159dff9418b243e2e31160ddc30","amp;dn":"Organophosphorus+%28V%29+Chemistry+-+Chris+Timperley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e52e1b4c62738159dff9418b243e2e31160ddc30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,46,27,76,98,115,129,89,223,249,65,139,36,62,46,49,22,13,220,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
