Twenty of the best free programs that are essential for everyday computer use. All Programs are compatible with Windows 10.\r\nThere are two updating types:\r\n1. Reinstalling the latest program version with an offline installer/standalone (donâ€™t need internet), Open the â€˜â€™1 Programsâ€™â€™ folder and manually install each program.\r\nCAUTION: Some installer, offers to install together other programs or features. They are advertising and unnecessary to you. Donâ€™t accept, clear it, uncheck. DO NOT install these additional.\r\nHere two examples: Skype: () Make Bing my search engine () make MSN my homepag uTorrent: () Yes Iâ€™d love to check out this download.\r\n\r\n2) Programs that has no offline installer, update through the program itself. They are: JDownloaderÂ®, AdobeÂ® and Windows update(OS). To update open the â€˜â€™Online Updateâ€™â€™ folder, open the program, open the menu, find the â€œupdateâ€ option and update it. The update option can be in: â€˜â€™Helpâ€™â€™ or â€œOptionsâ€ or â€œaboutâ€ or â€œToolsâ€ or â€œPreferencesâ€. Manually update each program.\r\nNote: The Firefox, Thunderbird, FirefoxPortable and ThunderbirdPortable (on drive C:/) are disabled automatic updates. But we changed our policy after RW was released and we ask the users to enable automatic update on those programs. The JDownloaderÂ® is disabled automatic update, we recommend manually update once every two months. After installing each program, that process may create new shortcuts (on your desktop, in your taskbar or in your Start menu). Those new shortcuts should be deleted, as they are duplicates of what RafaWay has already created for you and in a far more simplified fashion, as they are numbered, organized and have shorter names. The â€˜â€™Backup Programsâ€™â€™ folder, are installers who self-destroy after installation. After installing, copy to the â€˜â€™1 Programâ€™â€™ folder, so you have them for the next installation.\r\nThe newest version of PortableFirefox and PortableThunderbird are in the â€˜â€™RafaWayâ€™â€™ folder.\r\nThe â€˜â€™PDF Creatorâ€™â€™ program is installed in some RW Win10 versions. However, after RW Win10 was released, we decided Windows 10 donâ€™t need, it has already a PDF printer. Either you choose to upgrade to the latest version or uninstall it. Itâ€™s located on the â€˜â€™3 Other programsâ€™â€™ folder.\r\nYou can also manually download the latest version of each program, by importing bookmarks on â€˜â€™RafaWayâ€™â€™ folder. The bookmark folder is â€˜â€™03 RW Updateâ€™â€™\r\n\r\nFollowing are the twenty essential and free programs installed in RafaWay for Windows:\r\nâ€¢ Javaâ„¢ (32 &amp; 64 Bits)\r\nâ€¢ Browsers\r\nMozillaÂ® FirefoxÂ® and Google Chrome\r\nâ€¢ E-mail client\r\nMozillaÂ® ThunderbirdÂ®\r\nâ€¢ Instant messaging, VoIP and video calling\r\nSkypeÂ®\r\nâ€¢ P2P BitTorrent client for file sharing and downloading\r\nÂµTorrentÂ®\r\nâ€¢ Backup and file synchronization between PCs and smart devices\r\nOneDriveÂ®\r\nâ€¢ AdobeÂ® AIR\r\nâ€¢ File compression and archive unpacking\r\n7-Zip\r\nâ€¢ Media player\r\nVLC\r\nâ€¢ Flash video players &amp; Browser plugin AdobeÂ®â€™s ShockwaveÂ®, FlashÂ® Player, MicrosoftÂ® Silverlightâ„¢, Google Voice &amp; Hangouts (For IE, M.
