Andrews, J.R. Varley (WP, 2005).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-85573-775-4\r\n\r\nBiochemistry of milk products documents advances in the field and focuses on the two most active areas of research areas, which are starter cultures and enzymes for use in cheese and other foods, and factors influencing the functional properties of milk.\r\n\r\nThe book covers the current thinking and research on the roles of proteinases and peptidases in the milk clotting process and in texture and flavour development during maturation of product. It also covers the protein engineering of enzymes and molecular biological manipulation of microorganisms, including the use of protein engineering to clarify the molecular basis of functional behavior and to manipulate protein properties in a defined and planned way.\r\n\r\nBiochemistry of milk products provides important reading for research workers, lecturers, graduates and final year undergraduates with interest in the practical applications of molecular biology, enzymology, and protein chemistry, not just in improving the quality and performance of dairy foods and ingredients but also in a much wider context","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b792c17d3204599f461aad444ec2f4d02ac83021","amp;dn":"Biochemistry+of+Milk+Products","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b792c17d3204599f461aad444ec2f4d02ac83021","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,146,193,125,50,4,89,159,70,26,173,68,78,194,244,208,42,200,48,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
