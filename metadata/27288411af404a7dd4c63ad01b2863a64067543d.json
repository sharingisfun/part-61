Google and YouTube: RafaWay or RafaWay00\r\n\r\nMade by Rafael Jacob Galapo Rosenthal, a Human/Computer Interaction (HCI) developer.\r\n\r\nRafaWay for WindowsÂ® is the name given to the optimized customization of MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® 7, 8.1 and 10 in all of their different versions.\r\n\r\nIn this optimized customization, innovations have been incorporated relating to the operating systemâ€™s installation and use on, as well as the reformatting of, your computer.\r\nIn addition to including a complete solution for Cloud Computing, forty of the best free programs that are essential for everyday computer use have been added to the standard WindowsÂ® installation package.\r\nThese programs are installed in a way that improves the organization of your computer without adversely impacting its processing speed, thereby making it unnecessary to uninstall any of these additional programs that are not used or needed.\r\nBeyond RafaWay for WindowsÂ®, the vast majority of users will only need to install the Microsoft OfficeÂ® suite.\r\nFor quality assurance, RafaWay for WindowsÂ® installation tests were carried out on 300 computers with different configurations.\r\nUser reviews from those with the RafaWay customization on their computers confirm that their user experience is substantially improved when compared to the standard version of WindowsÂ®; productivity was improved and both beginners and advanced users were better served by the customized system. Significant advantages are observed in aspects such as:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Appreciable reduction in installation time, which takes 15 minutes with a DVD disk or USB flash drive. Time savings also occurred when reformatting a PC with a clean installation of MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ®, along with the additional programs; requiring less than 2 minutes and 15 clicks to complete the installation;\r\nâ€¢ Significant increase in processing speed;\r\nâ€¢ Enhanced security;\r\nâ€¢ Greater stability with fewer crashes and/or system reboots;\r\nâ€¢ Improved performance even when installed on older computers;\r\nâ€¢ User interface, whose menus, icons, shortcuts, toolbar, taskbar and default configuration are reorganized, thus making computers much more interactive and user friendly;\r\nâ€¢ Simplified, more intuitive operating system resources reduce time learning for users","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27288411af404a7dd4c63ad01b2863a64067543d","amp;dn":"Tutorial+%26amp%3B+Description+0722016+of+RafaWay+for+Windows+.tib+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27288411af404a7dd4c63ad01b2863a64067543d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,40,132,17,175,64,74,125,212,198,58,208,27,40,99,166,64,103,84,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
