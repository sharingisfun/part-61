They were busy performing\r\ntogether in Arcade Fire and Bell Orchestre, scoring the film Blue Caprice,\r\nsupporting each other at various shows, and releasing critically lauded solo\r\nalbums; namely, Stetson's New History Warfare record trilogy and Neufeld's Hero\r\nBrother from 2013. Thankfully, amidst that madness, they managed to put aside a\r\nweek here and a week there to combine their collective skills and extended\r\ntechniques into a singular effort that is ultimately greater than their\r\nindividual efforts.\r\n\r\nRecorded live with no overdubs or loops, Never were the way she was is a\r\nperfect blend of Neufeld's violin virtuosity and Stetson's outside-the-box\r\napproach to saxophone and clarinet, their styles complementing yet pushing each\r\nother to new heights. The album's theme follows the story of a woman who ages\r\nas slowly as the mountains, with its compositions following a trajectory from\r\nher playful youth to a kind of self-imposed exile from humanity. Yet, it's\r\nentirely instrumental, so the story is really up to the listener to imagine,\r\nand this album truly ignites the imagination.\r\n\r\nFrom the lightness of &quot;The sun roars into view,&quot; as the tenor sax and violin\r\ntimbres oscillate alongside each other, to the grimy dirge of &quot;With the dark\r\nhug of time,&quot; as the violin simmers pensively and contrabass clarinet chugs\r\nalong in a grim march while a tortured howl emotes through the texture, Never\r\nwere the way she was feels like it was destined to be.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Thom Jurek \nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/never-were-the-way-she-was-mw0002837032\r\n\r\nBy Janus and Karl \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2015/07/colin-stetsonsarah-neufeld-never-were.html\r\n\r\nBy Jayson Greene \nhttp://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20289-colin-stetson-sarah-neufeld-never-were-the-way-she-was/\r\n\r\nBy A Noah Harrison \nhttp://www.popmatters.com/review/193141-colin-stetson-and-sarah-neufeld-never-were-the-way-she-was/\r\n\r\nHenning Bolte (nl) \nhttp://www.writteninmusic.com/rock/colin-stetson-sarah-neufeld-never-were-the-way-she-was/\r\n\r\nDi Elena Raugei (it) \nhttp://ilmucchio.it/recensioni/musica/colin-stetson-and-sarah-neufeld/\r\n\r\nDi Stefano Pifferi (it) \nhttp://sentireascoltare.com/recensioni/colin-stetson-sarah-neufeld-never-were-the-way-she-was/\r\n\r\nPar Olivier Lamm (fr) \nhttp://next.liberation.fr/culture/2015/05/31/colin-stetson-et-sarah-neufeld-souffle-onirique-et-cordes-sensibles_1320398\r\n\r\nPar Anne Yven (fr) \nhttp://www.citizenjazz.com/Colin-Stetson-et-Sarah-Neufeld.html\r\n\r\nPor Ghost Writer (es)\r\n\r\nLa fonoscopia (es) \nhttp://www.lafonoscopia.com/2016/01/30/colin-stetson-sarah-neufeld-never-were-the-way-she-was/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0029852b178ddf1fb21b8fa9da5bbde952b35001","amp;dn":"Colin+Stetson%2C+Sarah+Neufeld+-+Never+Were+The+Way+She+Was+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0029852b178ddf1fb21b8fa9da5bbde952b35001","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,41,133,43,23,141,223,31,178,27,143,169,218,91,189,233,82,179,80,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
