This book includes chapters on the lysozyme of egg white, which contains seven threonine residues in the primary structure; the requirements of threonine for laying hens fed diets with increasing levels of threonine at variable and constant ratios; the role threonine may potentially play in intermolecular interactions towards ligands of small molecules and the highly mutated threonine-producer strains, and ways of optimization and intensification of its biosynthesis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df48e205a9f5c7b7e81230737cc2cb338c6597d9","amp;dn":"Threonine+-+Food+Sources%2C+Functions+and+Health+Benefits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df48e205a9f5c7b7e81230737cc2cb338c6597d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,72,226,5,169,245,199,183,232,18,48,115,124,194,203,51,140,101,151,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
