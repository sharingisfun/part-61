EO 12333. @paulr_gregory, @hooverinst. David Shedd, Heritage\r\n\r\n&quot;In the case of the Clinton emails, the Kremlin appears to be using its classic â€œMadeline Albright declarationâ€ approach. In the Albright case, an obscure and unidentified blogger, â€œNatalia 1001,â€ made the unsubstantiated claim that then Secretary of State, Madeline Albright, had declared that Siberia, with its rich resources, should belong to the United States, not to Russia. This false claim was repeated by multiple sources (including an FSB mind reader) until it has become an integral part of the Putin doctrine that the U.S. is an aggressive power intent on Russiaâ€™s demise.\r\n\r\n&quot;We are no closer to proof of whether Putin has Hillaryâ€™s emails or not. What we have is a troll attack that lays out a Kremlin narrative linking the Clinton emails to the Panama Papers. We expect the Kremlin to build on this narrative as time passes. In either case, Putin is sitting in the catbird seat. The mere suspicion that he has the email cache gives him leverage over the U.S. election. Those who argue that Clintonâ€™s use of an insecure private server is a minor dereliction do not understand the consequences of having the Secretary of Stateâ€™s correspondence in the hands of a hostile nation.&quot;\r\n \nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2016/06/05/putins-army-of-internet-trolls-is-influencing-the-hillary-clinton-email-scandal/#5735fd5f3b99","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d48ea0d7aa84acba892b6490a01dbf8900fe1383","amp;dn":"john+batchelor+Putins+Troll+Army.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d48ea0d7aa84acba892b6490a01dbf8900fe1383","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,142,160,215,170,132,172,186,137,43,100,144,160,29,191,137,0,254,19,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
