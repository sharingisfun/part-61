(CRC, 2011).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4398-4039-9\r\n\r\nHuman survival depends on the availability of clean air, water, and food and on the welfare of plants and animals. However, anthropogenic and naturally occurring chemicals can cause adverse effects on living organisms and ecological processes. Environmental Toxicology: Biological and Health Effects of Pollutants, Third Edition presents fundamental information on the effects of environmental toxicants on living systems. It focuses on the chemical and biological characteristics of major pollutants found in the air, water, and soil and relates them to the health and well being of humans, animals, and plants.\r\n\r\nAn Indispensable Reference on Air, Soil, &amp; Water Pollutants and Their Impact on Living Systems\r\n\r\nSurveying the environmental and health changes that have occurred in recent decades, the book discusses the sources, metabolism, and damage process of toxicants, and the environmental, biological, and nutritional factors that may influence toxicity. It looks at natural defense systems, including the mechanisms for detoxificationâ€”such as endogenous antioxidants and free radical scavenging enzymesâ€”on a cellular level.\r\n\r\nThe text examines the major toxicants: EPA criteria air pollutants, environmental fluoride, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), environmental metals and metalloids involved in soil and water pollution, and pesticides and related material such as PCBs and dioxins. It then addresses their relationship with endocrine disruption and environmental cancer. This comprehensive approach offers insight into the interaction of various chemical agents with DNA.\r\n\r\nFully revised and expanded, the third edition of this popular book includes new and updated material as well as a new chapter on occupational toxicology. Appendices cover the process of ecological risk assessment, carcinogens, and PCB nomenclature. Based on research from more than 35 years of teaching environmental toxicology and related courses, this textbook is a useful resource for students, professionals, and researchers interested in the effects of pollutants on living systems.\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s New in This Edition\r\n\r\nA new chapter on occupational toxicology, covering indoor air quality, chemicals in the workplace, nanoparticle exposure, and more\r\nAn updated chapter on environmental changes and health, including significant environmental changes that have occurred since the last edition\r\nAn updated chapter on environmental cancer, including changes in death rates of respiratory cancers\r\nNew material on the importance of nitrous oxide (N2O) in stratospheric ozone layer depletion\r\nAn expanded discussion of environmental disasters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cef33151cb7d0159794d2d900704312b0d2c587","amp;dn":"Environmental+Toxicology+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cef33151cb7d0159794d2d900704312b0d2c587","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,239,51,21,28,183,208,21,151,148,210,217,0,112,67,18,176,210,197,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
