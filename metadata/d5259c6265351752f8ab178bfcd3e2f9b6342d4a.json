The overall sound is thick and murky, but too muddy to be effectively atmospheric in the way that the more dynamic Disintegration managed a few years later. \r\n\r\nFor every powerful track like the doomy opener &quot;One Hundred Years&quot; and the clattering, desolate single &quot;The Hanging Garden,&quot; there's a sound-over-substance piece of filler like &quot;The Figurehead,&quot; which sounds suitably bleak but doesn't have the musical or emotional heft this sort of music requires. Pornography is an often intriguing listen, but it's just a bit too uneven to be considered a classic.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.One Hundred Years \r\n02.A Short Term Effect \r\n03.The Hanging Garden \r\n04.Siamese Twins \r\n05.The Figurehead \r\n06.A Strange Day \r\n07.Cold \r\n08.Pornography \r\n\r\n*1982 A&amp;M Records | 1987 # CD 4902 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5259c6265351752f8ab178bfcd3e2f9b6342d4a","amp;dn":"The+Cure+-+Pornography+%281982%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5259c6265351752f8ab178bfcd3e2f9b6342d4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,37,156,98,101,53,23,82,248,171,23,139,252,211,226,249,182,52,45,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
