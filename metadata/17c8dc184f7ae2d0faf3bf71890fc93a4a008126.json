However, their composition, architecture and bioactivity greatly vary from tissue to tissue in relation to the specific role the ECM is required to assume","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17c8dc184f7ae2d0faf3bf71890fc93a4a008126","amp;dn":"Composition+and+Function+of+the+Extracellular+Matrix+%282016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17c8dc184f7ae2d0faf3bf71890fc93a4a008126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,200,220,24,79,122,226,208,250,243,191,113,137,15,201,58,74,0,129,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
