Their style in general is like a more folky and acoustic version of the Indigo Girls, although they can pull the plugs out and do rock and psychedelia-as evidenced by their faithful version of 'White Rabbit'. \r\n\r\nThe CD-maxi single contains some stand out tracks. I think there were two other albums released by them before their eventual dissolution-I have them both...but neither are a pale shadow of their first two which are represented here. So take a chance on these relatively small downloads-these are easily worth the bandwidth\r\n\r\nI have also included their last and final album-Pristine Smut. This is more produced and less stripped down than the previous two","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f6191581dd7b41afb5eb65e2b6b3aa675a6524c","amp;dn":"The+Murmurs-s%2Ft%2C+White+Rabbit+EP%2C+Pristine+Smut+EAC+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f6191581dd7b41afb5eb65e2b6b3aa675a6524c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,97,145,88,29,215,180,26,251,94,182,94,43,107,58,166,117,166,82,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
