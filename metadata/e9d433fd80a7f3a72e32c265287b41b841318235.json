The Establishment Is Supposed to Be Against Trump\r\nAugust 09, 2016\r\n\r\nRUSH: We also have another round of 50 people, and it's many of the same people who've signed yet another letter. GOP foreign policy experts saying they will not vote for Trump.  We have Maine Senator Susan Collins saying she will not vote for Trump.  She's a Republican.
