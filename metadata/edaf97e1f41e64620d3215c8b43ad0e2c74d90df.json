Here are sixty decadent and delightful ice creams and the sixty desserts that are their vehicles. \r\n\r\nA la Mode offers not just solid dessert recipes, from raspberry oat bars to bear claws, from chocolate pecan pie to a white chocolate pavlova, but also gives you the unforgettable pairings that make these desserts smash hits: apple cranberry pie with Camembert ice cream, chocolate sheet cake with salt caramel frozen custard, and espresso cream jelly roll with mascarpone ice cream. Let's face it: vanilla can sometimes be so...vanilla. A great a-la-mode pairing should be as decadent as finding the perfect wine to go with your cheese plate. \r\n\r\nWith Ala Mode, IACP winners and cookbook dynamos Bruce Weinstein and Mark Scarborough show you how to create innovative delights such as creamy hazelnut gelato atop coffee- poaohed pears, or maple frozen custard with a mouth-watering cinnamon roll cake, alongside simpler classics like confetti ice cream with layered vanilla birthday cake.\r\n\r\nYou haven't lived until you've had peanut brittle pie with popcorn ice cream, a Cracker Jack fantasy! Because what's a warm pie without ice cream? With A la Mode, you'll never have to answer that question","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edaf97e1f41e64620d3215c8b43ad0e2c74d90df","amp;dn":"A+la+Mode+-+120+Recipes+in+60+Pairings+%282016%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edaf97e1f41e64620d3215c8b43ad0e2c74d90df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,175,151,225,244,30,100,98,13,50,21,200,180,58,208,226,199,77,144,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
