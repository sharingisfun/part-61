ONLY A few hundred years ago Scotland was a free and independant \r\nNation, before it was sold for Land and Gold without the people's consent, by\r\na handful of ruling elite.\r\n\r\nWe have tried to break away twice in my lifetime and in the 1970's \r\nwe said YES to Independance in a National Referendum by 5 clear \r\npercentage points only to have the rules changed after the vote\r\nby Westminster's ENGLISH MP's and Lords.\r\n\r\nHopefully this will happen again for the BritExit Europe Referendum.\r\n\r\nThe English, quite happy to take away Scotlands right to pass its own\r\nTaxation, Defence and Foreign Policy laws, does not like Europe forcing\r\nthem to clean up there beaches or abide by rules to help clean up this\r\nplanet, allow the youth the right to live and Work in any other EU Member\r\nstate OR standardise living standards and allow the stronger nations help\r\nthe weaker ones in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe ENGLISH and Welsh, Led by Populist Newpapers have turned there backs \r\non Fellow Man at a time when the World needs, more than EVER to pull \r\ntogether.   \r\n\r\nScotland said YES to remain in Europe by 12% and NOW we must pull apart from \r\nEngland to keep our ties, not only with our friends and customers in Europe,\r\nbut with the rest of the World.\r\n\r\nJames in this torrent sums it all up at the start of the track called\r\nTommorow.  It is marked EXPLICIT because they say to the BritExit voters\r\n.... FUCK YOU\r\n\r\nIt is NOT TOO LATE ENGLAND.. Do not press that Article 50 Button! Sorry\r\nWALES, but just like our VOTE in Scotland, you don't count.\r\n\r\nJames - Come Home (Glastonbury 2016) [Video].mpg\r\nJames - Curse Curse (Glastonbury 2016) [Video].mpg\r\nJames - Laid (Explicit) (Glastonbury 2016) [Video].mpg\r\nJames - Tommorow (Explicit) (Glastonbury 2016) [Video].mpg\r\nRonnie Spector - Back To Black (Glastonbury 2016) [Video].mpg\r\nRonnie Spector Feat.
