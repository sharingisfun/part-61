He is best known today for his voluminous publication of organ works, several of them still in the regular repertoire, but his classical works for orchestra deserve attention, as well. They were too studied for the pops, too musically advanced for the conservative academics. A lonely figure, he drew strength from the depth of his personal relationships, at home and at work.\r\n\r\nThis, his seventh symphony, is labeled The Dances of Life. While there's a general sense of historical progression, Tournemire has no intention of tying himself down, and his movement titles are meant more along the lines of general ideas than to be taken as a serious study of any given period--much less the fifth movement's &quot;future dance.&quot; He does however show a musical vocabulary enlarged from his earlier works by greater exposure to Ravel, Stravinsky, and Prokofiev. Tournemire was never content to stand still.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
