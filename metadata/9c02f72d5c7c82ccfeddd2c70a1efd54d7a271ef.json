The Journal publishes a variety of contributions, including original articles, general and focused reviews, and rapid communications (brief articles of particular interest and clear novelty). Selected cutting-edge topics will be addressed in Special Issues managed by Guest Editors. Special Issues will contain both commissioned reviews and invited original research to provide comprehensive coverage of specific topics, and all articles will undergo rigorous peer-review prior to publication.\r\nManuscripts relating to unsolved issues in genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, structural biology, steroid chemistry, cell biology, molecular medicine, and clinical medicine, are encouraged. Both basic and clinical areas of research are within the scope of the Journal, provided they address mechanisms or yield a functional explanation of processes involving steroids. A further aim of the Journal is to provide steroid-related tools, synthesis and analysis methods, and reference data.Contributions on case studies or descriptions of new compounds should provide new functional data. Otherwise they will be not considered. Reports on translational research are encouraged.\r\nThe aims of the Journal cover studies on steroid signal transduction pathways, functional annotation of genes and kinetics of metabolic pathways, as well as the creation of enduring and validated resources for metabolomics and systems biology analyses. Furthermore, the Journal also publishes results on lipid research, functional association studies or 'omics' that are instrumental in our understanding of common complex human diseases like metabolic syndrome, diabetes or obesity. Further aspects like steroid-related cancers or neurosteroids are within the scope of the Journal. The Journal aims to enhance our understanding, and the development of approaches to study, the interplay between the environment, genomes, metabolism and disease.\r\nStudies that are based on observations performed in a single cell line will not generally be viewed favourably for publication. The experiments should ideally include experiments with comparable cell lines to demonstrate generality or specificity of the effects or mechanisms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c02f72d5c7c82ccfeddd2c70a1efd54d7a271ef","amp;dn":"The+Journal+of+Steroid+Biochemistry+and+Molecular+Biology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c02f72d5c7c82ccfeddd2c70a1efd54d7a271ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,2,247,45,92,124,130,204,254,221,210,199,10,30,253,84,215,162,113,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
