The story was adapted by BrÃ¡ulio Mantovani from the 1997 novel of the same name written by Paulo Lins, but the plot is loosely based on real events. It depicts the growth of organized crime in the Cidade de Deus suburb of Rio de Janeiro, between the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1980s, with the closure of the film depicting the war between the drug dealer Li'l ZÃ© and vigilante-turned-criminal Knockout Ned. The tagline is &quot;If you run, the beast catches you; if you stay, the beast eats you&quot;, a proverb analogous to the English &quot;Damned if you do, damned if you don't&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe cast includes Alexandre Rodrigues, Leandro Firmino da Hora, Phellipe Haagensen, Douglas Silva, Alice Braga and Seu Jorge. Most of the actors were, in fact, residents of favelas such as Vidigal and the Cidade de Deus itself.\r\n\r\nThe film received worldwide critical acclaim, receiving four Academy Award nominations in 2004: Best Cinematography (CÃ©sar Charlone), Best Director (Meirelles), Best Editing (Daniel Rezende) and Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay) (Mantovani). Before that, in 2003 it had been chosen to be Brazil's runner for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but it was not nominated to be one of the five finalists. If it had been nominated, it would have been ineligible the next year for any other category. The film continued to be praised.\r\n\r\nMeirelles and Lund went on to create the City of Men TV series and film City of Men (2007), which share some of the actors (notably leads Douglas Silva and Darlan Cunha) and their setting with City of God","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c921ffc401b15b9a1d9e9eac56762020d7078604","amp;dn":"City+of+God+-+Barsil+-+MKV+-+Ignus+Draco","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c921ffc401b15b9a1d9e9eac56762020d7078604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,33,255,196,1,177,91,154,29,158,158,172,86,118,32,32,215,7,134,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
