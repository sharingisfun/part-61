Beautifully filmed on location in Morocco. (Contains some violence.) Approx. 3 hours\r\n\r\nThe world-changing saga of Paul the Apostle.\r\n\r\nThe early first century followers of Jesus were a small, struggling group within Judaism who seemingly posed no threat to anyone, certainly not the mighty Roman empire. But there was one determined to see this fledging faith exterminated. His name was Saul and he became the greatest persecutor of the early church. But within a matter of a few years, the Christians fiercest opponent became its most effective advocate.\r\n\r\nStruck down by a powerful conversion experience on the road to Damascus, Saul--his name changed to Paul--went on to become the greatest missionary in the history of Christianity. He went on to write more of the New Testament books than any other. In this impressive drama starring Garry Cooper we follow Saul the angry zealot to Paul the servant of Christ who will pay any price to bring his message to the world.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\r\n\r\n  * Biographical information on leading actors\r\n  * Chapter titles provided for easy scene access\r\n  * Extra bonus feature: I, Paul -- a reenactment of II Timothy\r\n\r\nPeter &amp; Paul\r\n\r\nAnthony Hopkins stars in this epic network television mini-series that brings to life the precarious existence of early Christianity.
