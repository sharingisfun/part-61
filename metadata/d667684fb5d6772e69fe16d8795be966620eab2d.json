It comes as an upgrade to Mac OS X 10.11.4 El Capitan.\r\nTagged as build 15F34, the OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 update has been released to improve the security, stability, and compatibility of your Mac computer, be it a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, or the new MacBook. As expected, this is a recommended update for all users running OS X El Capitan.\r\n\r\nWhat's new in Mac OS X 10.11.5 El Capitan \r\n\r\nAs mentioned, Mac OS X 10.11.5 El Capitan is a minor update that only fixes an issue that could have caused the Spotlight feature to consume a large amount of CPU time if a configuration profile was applied to set allowSpotlightInternetResults. At the same time, it takes care of an issue that might have occurred when attempting to apply a configuration profile to set the ShutDownDisabledWhileLoggedIn option.\r\nLastly, the OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 update addresses an issue with Startup Disk, which only displayed a single NetBoot image. In related news, today Apple has released the iOS 9.3.2 mobile operating system for supported iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices, along with watchOS 2.2.1 for Apple Watch devices, and tvOS 9.2.1 for Apple TVs.
