She also carrying your baby. Nothing that youâ€™re doing up there is as important as Quinn right now. I suggest you get your ass into gear and get home to your wife.â€\r\n\r\n\r\nStill reeling from the shock of discovering his wife's infidelity, Judd Altman learns that he has lost his father and will be one himself. His soon to be ex-wife, Quinn, is pregnant with his child.\r\nAfter almost losing the baby, Wade (Judd's old boss and Quinn's lover) realizes the truth about himself and his relationship with Quinn and leaves her. Judd, in the face of Quinn's situation, forgives her, but cannot reconcile their marriage.\r\nWith nothing but a stolen Porsche, Judd drives to Maine with limitless possibilities. A man with nothing has nothing to lose, and a man with nothing to lose can do anything.\r\nTwenty Four Weeks begins with Judd's time of reflection in Maine and his eventual decision to return to New York City, to take back the life that has been so cruelly taken from him. Sometimes humorous, this bitter-sweet tale is full of hope, love and forgiveness.\r\nWith characters and back story based on the novel &quot;This is Where I Leave You&quot; by Jonathan Tropper, Twenty Four Weeks is set after the events of the movie of the same name","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36c5a88236cc7c4ba74d5094ba04cc7105500707","amp;dn":"Twenty+Four+Weeks+-+Episode+1++-+%26quot%3BTwelve%26quot%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36c5a88236cc7c4ba74d5094ba04cc7105500707","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,197,168,130,54,204,124,75,167,77,80,148,186,4,204,113,5,80,7,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
