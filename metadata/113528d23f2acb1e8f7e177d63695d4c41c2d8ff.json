In fact, it features music by Carlton and Aston &quot;Family Man&quot; Barrett -- drummer and bassman for the Wailers, as well as Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare, who formed the rhythm section for both Peter Tosh and Black Uhuru. These two rhythm sections are the premier drum and bass duos from reggae history. You cannot find more roots &quot;riddims&quot; anywhere.\r\nAnd there is no one who can dub it out like King Tubby. He is the original King of spaced out, echo chamber dub music. If you are a seasoned reggae / dub enthusiast, this record will give you that old time feeling like when you first discovered dub. Remember when you used to come home from the party and put on your headphones as you passed out? It's all in this record. Some of these songs have appeared on compilations over the years, but this is the quintessential collection of King Tubby dub stylee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:113528d23f2acb1e8f7e177d63695d4c41c2d8ff","amp;dn":"King+Tubby+-+100%25+of+Dub+%28compilation%29%2C+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"113528d23f2acb1e8f7e177d63695d4c41c2d8ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,53,40,210,63,42,203,30,143,126,23,125,99,105,93,76,65,194,216,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
