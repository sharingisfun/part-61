Richard Basehart, as Admiral Nelson, and David Hedison, as Captain Crane commanded the glass-nosed, nuclear-powered Seaview for 110 episodes over four seasons on ABC. The first season, shot in black and white ran for 32 episodes and mixed espionage, the Cold War, and science fiction in a successful blend. The second year went to color and ran 26 episodes. With a big budget and color, plus a re-fitted Seaview and the addition of the classic Flying Sub, the second year was truly epic. A budget cut was sometimes apparent in the 26 episode third year, but good writing still turned out some classic adventures. An increased budget improved the 26 episode fourth year, where Voyage set a record for an American science fiction television program when it hit it's 100th episode. Richard Basehart and David Hedison turned in consistently fine performances, even when confronted with less than sophisticated material. \r\n\r\n\r\n01\t01x01\t14/Sep/1964\t Eleven Days to Zero\r\n02\t01x02\t21/Sep/1964\t The City Beneath the Sea\r\n03\t01x03\t28/Sep/1964\t The Fear-Makers\r\n05\t01x05\t12/Oct/1964\t The Price of Doom\r\n07\t01x07\t26/Oct/1964\t Turn Back the Clock\r\n08\t01x08\t02/Nov/1964\t The Village of Guilt\r\n09\t01x09\t09/Nov/1964\t Hot Line\r\n10\t01x10\t16/Nov/1964\t Submarine Sunk Here\r\n12\t01x12\t30/Nov/1964\t No Way Out\r\n13\t01x13\t07/Dec/1964\t The Blizzard Makers\r\n14\t01x14\t14/Dec/1964\t The Ghost of Moby Dick\r\n15\t01x15\t21/Dec/1964\t Long Live the King\r\n16\t01x16\t28/Dec/1964\t Hail to the Chief\r\n17\t01x17\t04/Jan/1965\t The Last Battle\r\n18\t01x18\t11/Jan/1965\t Mutiny\r\n20\t01x20\t25/Jan/1965\t The Invaders\r\n21\t01x21\t01/Feb/1965\t The Indestructible Man\r\n22\t01x22\t08/Feb/1965\t The Buccaneer\r\n23\t01x23\t15/Feb/1965\t The Human Computer\r\n24\t01x24\t22/Feb/1965\t The Saboteur\r\n25\t01x25\t01/Mar/1965\t Cradle of the Deep\r\n27\t01x27\t15/Mar/1965\t The Exile\r\n28\t01x28\t22/Mar/1965\t The Creature\r\n29\t01x29\t29/Mar/1965\t The Enemies\r\n30\t01x30\t05/Apr/1965\t The Secret of the Loch\r\n32\t01x32\t19/Apr/1965\t The Traitor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a5ad0b5a2ec2150e39e53bbffd80526ccc47f43","amp;dn":"Voyage+to+the+Bottom+of+the+Sea+-+Season+1+-+Episodes+17+thru+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a5ad0b5a2ec2150e39e53bbffd80526ccc47f43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,90,208,181,162,236,33,80,227,158,83,187,255,216,5,38,204,196,127,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
