Maslow introduced the world to Humanistic Theory, a 'third force' in psychology was born (Behaviorism &amp; Psychoanalytical theory being the first and second). As the name suggests, humanistic theory concerns itself with characteristics which are distinctly human.\r\n\r\nArguably the best known example of such a characteristic is Self-Actualization, an innate motivating force unique to the human species. It was in this landmark publication that Maslow provided the first published representation of Self-Actualization at the pinnicle of a hierarchy of human needs. According to Maslow Self-Actualization refers to the desire for self-fulfillment, in essence to become everything that one is capable of becoming.\r\n\r\nThis classic publication is essential reading for psychology students, educators and professionals.\r\n\r\nHierarchy of Needs: A Theory of Human Motivation (Kindle Edition) forms part of an initiative by the website www.all-about-psychology.com to make important, insightful and engaging psychology publications widely available","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2492584e86c24d142c7c76c6c02d150757168c59","amp;dn":"Theory+of+Human+Motivation+by+A.+H.+Maslo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2492584e86c24d142c7c76c6c02d150757168c59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,146,88,78,134,194,77,20,44,124,118,198,192,45,21,7,87,22,140,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
