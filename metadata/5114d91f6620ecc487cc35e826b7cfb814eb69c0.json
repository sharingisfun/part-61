All the way from the premise, to the details, to the motivation, he took 'em all on.\r\n\r\nHillary Campaign Colludes with Media to Fake &quot;Veterans Against Trump&quot; Protest\r\n\r\nRUSH: She is no competition for Trump.  If Trump were a radio show and Hillary were a radio show, he would be me, and she would be Air America.  Which is what I mean.  So the press is doing exactly to her what they did to Air America:  Build 'em up, cut down Trump, do everything they can to cut down Trump, build her up, because, in their minds, the competition is unfair.  It's always gonna be unfair when the Democrat is seen lacking... The people that protested against Trump outside Trump Tower, they were military people.  They were just bought and paid for by the Clinton campaign.  They were vets.  They were not made-up vets.  They were not actors in that sense.  It's just had they not been bought and paid for by the Clinton campaign, they wouldn't have been there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Politics of the Gorilla Story\r\n\r\nUSH: There was politics in this Cincinnati Zoo thing because there's politics in everything.  Can't take it out.  Can't escape it.  Can't avoid it.  And I'm gonna explain that.\r\nMorning Update: Liberal Hot Mess\r\nMay 31, 2016\r\nRemember 2008, students all over America jumped on the Obama bandwagon of â€œhope and change?â€ Well, over the weekend, the New York Times revealed the â€œchangesâ€ students got for their votes.\r\n\r\nNewt Says Trump Will Change the Electoral Map... How Bad Was that Monster Storm That Ripped Through the Carolinas? \r\n\r\nKatie Couric (Not a Nice Person) Takes Responsibility for Deceptive Editing\r\n\r\nRUSH: She feels confident going out there and taking the hit 'cause she knows it's gonna all be over by the next day.  And no harm, no foul, and she'll still be doing what she's doing the same way she's doing it.  In other words, getting away with it -- except when she's caught.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clinton Has No Audience\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSH: Hillary Clinton cannot announce she's gonna be at the Cow Palace somewhere and have it automatically fill up because there are people that want to see her.  They have to work at filling whatever venue she decides to show up at.  Her book?  Nobody showed up at signings.  It was a bomb in term of sales. She has no connection with people. \r\n \nhttp://www.rushlimbaugh.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5114d91f6620ecc487cc35e826b7cfb814eb69c0","amp;dn":"Rush+Limbaugh+-+May+31%2C+2016+Full+Podcast.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5114d91f6620ecc487cc35e826b7cfb814eb69c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,20,217,31,102,32,236,196,135,204,53,232,38,183,207,184,20,235,105,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
