So I compiled my own, with a couple of sound-grabs for your enjoyment. They may not necesserily be all funny bits, but important just the same. Certainly not a blockbuster, according to the critics, but in my opinion, a nice story and pretty cool soundtrack by all accounts. \r\n\r\nThe following tracks appear in a chronological order and all tags are provided. I really hope you all enjoy what I beleive to be the COMPLETE and CORRECT version of one of Kevin Smith's earlier classics.\r\n\r\n1.  ViewAskew Productions Intro.\r\n2.  Everyone's a Kid at Christmas Time.\r\n3.  Let's Stay Together.\r\n4.  Coked Out Whores (Dialogue).\r\n5.  The Quote for the Madonna Release (Dialogue).\r\n6.  That's When I Knew This Story Would Break My Heart.\r\n7.  That Baby Smells Like Shit (Dialogue).\r\n8.  Parents Just Don't Understand.\r\n9.  Is That Blow On Your Shirt (Dialogue).\r\n10. Shut the Hell Up with the Fresh Prince (Dialogue).\r\n11. Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.\r\n12. No Whores (Dialogue).\r\n13. I'm Just Your Dad (Dialogue).\r\n14. Worlds, They Rise and Fall.\r\n15. Let Me See (Dialogue).\r\n16. What are Your Intentions With my Daughter (Dialogue).\r\n17. Joanna (Johnny Depp &amp; Jamie Campbell Bower 'Sweeney Todd-DVD' Version).\r\n18.  What Are Your Intentions With My Father (Dialogue).\r\n19. Wandering.\r\n20. Landslide.\r\n21. My City in Ruins.\r\n22. Will 'n' Ben Rappin' (Dialogue).\r\n23. High.\r\n24. God That's Good. (Jersey Girl Version).\r\n25. Let My Love Open The Door To Your Heart.\r\n26. Jersey Girl (Closing Credits).\r\n27. God That's Good [BONUS TRACK] \r\n(Helena Bonham Carter and Edward Sanders 'Sweeney Todd-DVD' Version).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs one dedicated 'Smith' fan to another, please be civil with any suggestions of edits or ommitions.
