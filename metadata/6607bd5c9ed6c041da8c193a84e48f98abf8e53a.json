Bob and Jane are locked in a cycle of over eating and excessive drinking that is making them so unhappy it's threatening to drive them apart. Eating vast meals and drinking up to 25 bottles of wine a week has replaced having fun in their relationship.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tanya Byron and her team separate them for 10 weeks. She discovers that at the root of Jane's drinking is unhappiness and arranges a meeting for Jane and her adult daughter to solve a long-standing issue.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, fitness expert Rick Shakes-Braithwaite introduces the couple to the fun of exercise. Bob, a former semi-professional footballer, initially starts off enthusiastically, but eventually he's back at the pub with his old friends, ignoring advice from Professor Paul Dolan on controlled drinking. Can his daughter's concern for his health do the trick?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6607bd5c9ed6c041da8c193a84e48f98abf8e53a","amp;dn":"Lose.Weight.for.Love.s01e03.EN.SUB.HEVC.x265.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6607bd5c9ed6c041da8c193a84e48f98abf8e53a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,7,189,92,158,214,192,65,218,140,25,58,132,228,143,152,171,248,229,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
