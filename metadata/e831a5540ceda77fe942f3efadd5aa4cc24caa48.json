Background music is exclusive and each level has different melody while playing the game, Geometry Dash. The game user is not supposed or does not have to complete a level to go to the next one, however, the further you go, the more difficult it becomes. Some other features introduced in the game include a level editor, map packs, hidden coins the modes and so on. Geometry Dash is rated 3+ and the size of the game is only 3M, so it does not occupy the space. Geometry Dash is a dynamic game and so addictive that after beginning to play the game itâ€™s too hard to give it up as floppy bird.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n\r\nAs for the controlling system, ITâ€™s a walk in the park to control different vehicles that move when a player touches the screen and can be interacted anytime the player presses on the touchscreen. Whatâ€™s more, the speed of moving icon is impossible to be controlled by you, unless it is not changed. However, time and rhythm are the main and key parts of Geometry Dash. The goal of Geometry Dash is to overcome a level by finishing it or reaching the end of it but, unfortunately, if the player bumps into an object or a barrier, he or she has to start the level over from the scratch.Not even a single level is locked from the beginning or later, so any of it can be chosen to play without an order. Apart from the above-mentioned facts, the player can collect maximum three coins which are on the ground or in the air in hidden areas. It is said that Geometry Dash looks like a lot of games, such as floppy bird, 2013 game created by Nguyen Ha Dong and published by Gears Studio. Ironically, the floppy bird was removed from the App Store from Google owing to its addictive nature. The point is that after its removal, the games like floppy bird gained incomparable popularity throughout the internet just like Geometry Dash.\r\n\r\nNote: I do not own this game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e831a5540ceda77fe942f3efadd5aa4cc24caa48","amp;dn":"Geometry+Dash+with+Cheats","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e831a5540ceda77fe942f3efadd5aa4cc24caa48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,49,165,84,12,237,167,127,233,66,243,239,173,213,170,76,194,76,170,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
