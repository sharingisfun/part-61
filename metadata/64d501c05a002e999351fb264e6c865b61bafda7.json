The French have removed large numbers of troops from their African positions leaving the way open for revolt. American soldier of fortune Mike Conway sees a chance to pay his way back to the United States by gunrunning to hostile Tuaregs. Armed with a Thompson sub machine gun Conway finds himself walking a razor's edge between an anti-French Tuareg leader keen for his supply of weapons, a moderate Imam wanting peace, the local French Foreign Legion commander, and the commander's attractive wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 720x400, 25.000 fps, 1830 Kbps, 01h27m49s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, DUAL Audio Tracks English and Spanish\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles Greek, Portuguese-Brazil, Spanish\r\n\r\nscreenshot &amp; poster gallery: \nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/2oqvnvdfm/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64d501c05a002e999351fb264e6c865b61bafda7","amp;dn":"Timbuktu+%5B1958+-+USA%5D+%28Victor+Mature%29+adventure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64d501c05a002e999351fb264e6c865b61bafda7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,213,1,192,90,0,46,153,147,81,251,38,78,108,134,91,97,186,253,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
