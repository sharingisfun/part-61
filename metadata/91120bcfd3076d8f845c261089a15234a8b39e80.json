The town of Dry Fork, southern Texas, had buried him years before when Uncle Joe Vickers had fired off both barrels of a shotgun into the vicious outlaw's face as he was escaping from jail. Now, Uncle Joe has been shot-in just the same way. And Judge Upshaw had found a noose hanging on his door.\r\n\r\nShadow of a Star\r\nDeputy Sheriff Jim-Bob McClain isn't sure he's ready to follow in his father's footsteps as the law in Coolridge County. In fact, he has a hard enough time keeping the peace between the drunks in the local saloon. But with tough Sheriff Mont Naylor to back him up he figures he can handle whatever comes his way. Jim-Bob's first real assignment is no piece of cake. He must escort a ruthless outlaw into the hands of justice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91120bcfd3076d8f845c261089a15234a8b39e80","amp;dn":"Elmer+Kelton-Shadow+of+a+Star+%26amp%3B+Donovan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91120bcfd3076d8f845c261089a15234a8b39e80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,18,11,207,211,7,109,143,132,92,38,16,137,161,82,52,168,179,158,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
