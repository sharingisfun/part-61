As such, he met with great resistance from critics and audiences in his final years. His Second Symphony, however, was Late Romantic, composed at the end of WWI. It was a war symphony, no question of that: Madetoja never denied it, and while he wrote it, both his brother, involved in the Finnish Civil War, and a close friend, composer Toivo Kuula, were killed. In four movements, with great force and imagination, no other work by Madetoja was ever so well received.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
