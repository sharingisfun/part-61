Originally released in 1980, Absolutely moved away from the band's Ska origins and embraced a style that mixed Reggae, '60s Pop, Music Hall and other genres together into a wholly unified sound. In other words, Absolutely was the first album that truly represented Madness' unique and timeless sound.\r\n\r\nDisc One includes the original album plus seven bonus audio tracks and three enhanced videos. Disc Two contains 15 tracks recorded live at the Hammersmith Odeon. Digipak features original album artwork and 24 page color booklet including lyrics, photos and liner notes by journalist Paul Lester.\r\n\r\nFor their second album, Madness continued the bright and bouncy fun of their debut. Absolutely placed slightly more emphasis on their novelty aspect, creating something of a fun-house atmosphere with stray sounds, exaggerated accents, faster tempos, and often unintelligible lyrics rattled off by Suggs at breakneck speed. Although the album shows a dip in quality control and much less diversity than One Step Beyond, it is nevertheless a charming romp with its share of inspired moments, like the classic singles &quot;Baggy Trousers&quot; and &quot;Embarrasment.&quot;\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n01.
