The original health food, the vitamin-packed nut is now used industrially, in confectionary, and in all sorts of cooking. The first book to tell the full story of how nuts came to be in almost everything, Nuts takes readers on a gastronomic, botanical, and cultural tour of the world.\r\n\r\nTracking these fruits and seeds through cultivation, harvesting, processing, and consumptionâ€”or non-consumption, in the case of those with nut allergiesâ€”award-winning food writer Ken Albala provides a fascinating account on how they have been cooked, prepared, and exploited. He reveals the social and cultural meaning of nuts during various periods in history, while also immersing us in their modern uses. Packing scrumptious recipes, surprising facts, and fascinating nuggets inside its hardcover shell, this entertaining and informative book will delight lovers of almonds, hazelnuts, chestnuts, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n                          Visit us for more Awesome ebooks             \r\n\r\n                               http://booksdeity.com/\r\n \r\n                         **********************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24a3ab064c54bc64a027406552d8d387f6cfccb6","amp;dn":"Nuts+A+Global+History+by+Ken+Albala.epub+%7BBD%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24a3ab064c54bc64a027406552d8d387f6cfccb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,163,171,6,76,84,188,100,160,39,64,101,82,216,211,135,246,207,204,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
